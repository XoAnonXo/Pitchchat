1. Visual Cleanliness & Hierarchy

Hume: Uses clear sectioning with ample whitespace, separating navigation, headers (like “Featured Voices”), content cards, and controls for excellent scan-ability and less cognitive load.

Current Replit App: Standard dev interface with dense panels, minimal visual hierarchy, and typical utility-focused Replit tooling UI.

Design Tip:
Adopt more deliberate content sections in your app:

Add padding and visual separation between different content blocks (e.g., chats, agent commands, and file uploads).

Use headings, cards, and divider lines to segment sections.

2. Sidebar and Navigation

Hume: Uses a minimalist, vertical navigation sidebar with clearly labeled sections, icons, and grouped navigation.

Current Replit App: Replit’s system side/top bar and tabs, less custom control.

Design Tip:
Introduce a fixed vertical sidebar for navigation in your app.

Place your main pages (Dashboard, Chat, Files, Voices, Settings…) with icons and labels for quick access.

Highlight the current section, and collapse unneeded options for simplicity.

3. Cards & Lists for Items

Hume: Content (like voice profiles) is presented as cards with description, image/avatar, and clearly styled action buttons (e.g., Play, Info, More).

Current Replit App: No special card styling.

Design Tip:
Implement card-based layouts for key data:

Make agent/chat messages, voice options, or configurable modules appear inside lightly elevated “cards.”

Add a title, subtitle, avatar/icon, description, and action buttons.

Use background color and box-shadow for depth.

4. Accent Color & Buttons

Hume: Uses a consistent accent color (often a bold yellow/orange) for CTAs (call-to-action buttons), links, and highlights to draw attention.

Current Replit App: Default Replit (blue system) buttons and toggles.

Design Tip:
Pick a bold accent color (like orange: #FFA500 or a similar variation) and use it for:

Primary action buttons (Submit, Play, Deploy)

Highlights and focus states

5. Typography & Icons

Hume: Uses larger titles, clear font hierarchy, and subtle supporting text. Icons support quick navigation.

Current Replit App: Default system fonts; little variation.

Design Tip:

Use a modern sans-serif font (like Inter, IBM Plex, or similar).

Increase heading sizes, and use lighter font for less important text.

Add icons next to navigation/text labels for clarity.

Summary of what to do in your Replit app (PitchChatAI):

Build a sidebar nav with icons and page labels, styled similarly to Hume.

Use card layouts for presenting data, agent results, or user interactions.

Add whitespace, padding, and clear content blocks.

Pick and consistently use a distinct Hume-style accent color (#FFA500 is a solid choice).

Use bigger, cleaner typography and support with small icons and visual indicators.
