          "category": "Technical Readiness",
          "question": "What is your current Technology Readiness Level and what milestones will advance it?",
          "answer": "NASA's TRL scale (1-9) is the standard framework investors use to assess aerospace technical maturity. At seed stage, most startups are TRL 3-5: analytical and experimental proof-of-concept in laboratory environment progressing toward relevant environment testing. Be specific about your current TRL with evidence. Define the next 2-3 milestones that advance your TRL with realistic timelines. Investors understand aerospace development takes time but want to see clear milestone-based progress."

          "category": "Manufacturing Readiness",
          "question": "What's your Manufacturing Readiness Level and path to production scale?",
          "answer": "MRL complements TRL for hardware companies. Seed-stage aerospace companies typically target MRL 4-5: capability to produce prototype components in production-relevant environment. Discuss your manufacturing approach: in-house vs. contract manufacturing, key supplier relationships, and capital requirements for scaling. Investors want to see you've thought through the production challenges, not just the technology. Reference any manufacturing partnerships or LOIs."
        },
        {
          "category": "Regulatory Pathway",
          "question": "What's your regulatory pathway and timeline for key certifications?",
          "answer": "Aerospace regulatory landscape includes FAA (launch licenses, airworthiness), FCC (spectrum), NOAA (remote sensing), and potentially ITAR/export controls. Map your specific regulatory requirements with realistic timelines. Show you understand the process—investors have been burned by founders who underestimate regulatory complexity. If you've had preliminary discussions with regulators, highlight this. First-mover advantage in certain approvals can be significant moat."

        {
          "category": "Government vs Commercial",
          "question": "What's your go-to-market strategy: government contracts, commercial, or both?",
          "answer": "Aerospace markets split between government (DoD, NASA, civil agencies) and commercial (telecom, remote sensing, logistics). Each has different sales cycles, margins, and scaling dynamics. Government provides validation and patient capital but has long cycles and compliance burden. Commercial offers faster iteration but requires market creation. Most seed-stage companies focus on one initially—explain your choice and eventual expansion strategy."

        {
          "category": "Capital Intensity",
          "question": "How much capital will you need to reach commercial operations and what's the funding strategy?",
          "answer": "Aerospace is capital-intensive by nature. Investors want honesty about total capital requirements. Map your funding strategy: seed for core technology validation, Series A for prototype demonstration, later rounds for manufacturing scale. Include non-dilutive funding sources: SBIR/STTR, NASA contracts, DoD partnerships. Show you understand the fundraising landscape and have a realistic plan that doesn't assume smooth sailing."

        {
          "category": "Team Expertise",
          "question": "What aerospace/space experience does your team have and what gaps exist?",
          "answer": "Aerospace requires deep domain expertise. Highlight team members' backgrounds: prior aerospace companies, government agencies, relevant research. Be honest about gaps and your hiring plan. Investors look for: systems engineering experience, regulatory expertise, manufacturing knowledge, and government contracting familiarity. Advisory boards can fill gaps, but core team needs hands-on aerospace experience."
        },
        {
          "category": "Launch & Dependencies",
          "question": "What are your launch or critical infrastructure dependencies?",
          "answer": "Space companies depend on launch access; aviation companies depend on airports and airspace. Identify your critical dependencies and mitigation strategies. For launch: relationships with providers, manifested slots, cost projections. Discuss backup options and how dependency risk affects your timeline. Investors have seen many space startups delayed by launch availability—show you've planned for this."

        {
          "category": "Competitive Landscape",
          "question": "How do you differentiate from well-funded competitors like SpaceX, Planet, Rocket Lab?",
          "answer": "The aerospace startup landscape is crowded with well-funded competitors. Differentiation requires specificity: unique technology approach, underserved market segment, cost structure advantage, or specialized expertise. Avoid claiming you'll 'out-execute' larger players. Show deep understanding of competitive positioning and why your wedge is defensible. Investors want to see you've mapped the landscape and found genuine whitespace."
        },
        {
          "category": "Timeline Reality",
          "question": "What's your realistic timeline to key technical and commercial milestones?",
          "answer": "Aerospace timelines are notoriously optimistic. Investors discount founder projections heavily. Present a realistic timeline with built-in contingency. Reference industry benchmarks—how long similar systems took to develop. Show you understand what can go wrong and have buffer built in. Credibility comes from acknowledging aerospace complexity, not from aggressive promises."

          "answer": "Aerospace exits include strategic acquisition (prime contractors, tech companies entering space), private equity, and potentially IPO for larger outcomes. Research recent transactions in your segment with valuation multiples. Discuss strategic interest you've received or could attract. Show you understand the M&A landscape and how your company fits. Investors need to see a path to liquidity given long development timelines."

          "answer": "Investors hear this concern constantly in AI deals. Your answer should focus on defensibility layers: proprietary training data that would take years to replicate, domain-specific fine-tuning that requires deep expertise, unique data flywheels where user interactions improve your model, or workflow integration that creates switching costs. Avoid claiming your prompt engineering is a moat. Instead, show how your approach compounds value over time in ways that big tech cannot easily replicate with scale alone."

          "category": "Data Strategy",
          "question": "What is your data moat and how do you ensure you have rights to your training data?",
          "answer": "Data provenance is now a legal and competitive battleground. Explain where your training data comes from, whether you have explicit licenses or consent, and how you handle potential copyright or privacy issues. The best answers show proprietary data sources: first-party user data with clear consent, partnerships with data owners, or synthetic data generation capabilities. Investors want to avoid companies that could face lawsuits or lose access to critical training data."

          "answer": "AI startups often underestimate compute costs. Walk through your current cost per inference, how that changes at 10x and 100x scale, and your strategy for cost reduction. This might include model distillation, quantization, custom hardware, or architectural optimizations. Show you understand the path from current margins (which may be negative) to sustainable unit economics. Investors have seen too many AI companies with impressive demos but broken economics."

          "category": "Product Differentiation",
          "question": "Why can't a customer just use ChatGPT or Claude directly instead of your product?",
          "answer": "This is the 'wrapper company' objection. Your answer should articulate value beyond the base model: specialized domain knowledge, proprietary workflows, data integrations the customer needs, compliance and security requirements, or dramatically better UX for a specific use case. The strongest answers show that even if the underlying model commoditizes, your product layer remains valuable because of how it solves the complete customer problem."

Describe your primary channel (product-led growth, outbound sales, partnerships), your customer acquisition cost, and early signs of repeatability. For enterprise AI, explain your champion-building strategy and how you navigate procurement. For prosumer or SMB, show activation and retention metrics.

Highlight relevant ML publications, experience at top AI labs or companies, successful AI products shipped, or deep domain expertise in your target vertical. If your team lacks traditional ML credentials, explain your compensating strengths: perhaps you are domain experts who have assembled strong technical advisors, or you have a track record of rapid technical learning and execution."

Explain what has changed recently that makes your approach newly viable: perhaps new model capabilities, dropping inference costs, regulatory clarity, or shifting customer willingness to adopt AI. Show you understand the technology evolution curve and why your solution is possible and necessary today when it was not two years ago."

Explain which regulatory frameworks apply to your use case, how you are building compliance into your product, and whether regulation might actually benefit you by raising barriers to entry. Show awareness of risks like algorithmic bias, explainability requirements, and data privacy obligations."

          "answer": "Map the competitive landscape honestly: other startups, incumbents adding AI features, and potential big tech entry. For each category, explain your differentiation. Avoid claiming you have no competitors, as investors view this skeptically. The best answers show you have studied alternatives deeply and can articulate specific advantages: faster time-to-value, better accuracy on target use cases, stronger integrations, or more suitable pricing for your segment."

Paint a picture of where this goes: from initial wedge to platform, from one use case to many, from one vertical to horizontal expansion. Ground this in realistic market sizing for your initial beachhead, then show how success there unlocks larger opportunities. Avoid hand-wavy claims about AI transforming everything.

Your answer should focus on what remains durable even as underlying models improve: your unique data assets, customer relationships, workflow integration, domain expertise, and brand in your vertical. Show how you architect your system to benefit from model improvements rather than being displaced by them. The best AI companies become better as models improve, not obsolete."

Present your regulatory map: which licenses you need (money transmitter, lending, banking charter, broker-dealer), current status, and timeline.

If using a bank partnership or BaaS provider, explain the relationship structure and your compliance responsibilities. Address how regulations differ by state/market and your expansion strategy. Show you understand the regulatory landscape: 'We're pursuing money transmission licenses in 10 states covering 80% of our target market. We've secured licenses in NY, CA, and TX.

Address the full stack: product, compliance, risk, operations, and technology. If gaps exist, explain your advisory board or hiring plans. Show you have access to regulatory and banking relationship expertise. Reference specific relevant experiences: 'Our CRO spent 8 years at a top-10 U.S. bank building risk infrastructure. Our compliance lead held senior roles at a licensed neobank through its multi-state licensing process.'"

Present your approach with clear rationale: contract manufacturing reduces capital but limits control; in-house provides quality control but requires facility investment. For CM approach, show your supplier evaluation and relationship development. For in-house, show facility plans and equipment requirements. Address how the strategy might evolve with scale."

Validate that your target price works in the market: customer interviews, pilot pricing tests, competitive positioning. Show willingness-to-pay research and how it maps to your cost structure. For B2B hardware, include ROI analysis customers have validated. Investors have seen too many hardware startups with great technology but unworkable economics."

Highlight relevant experience: prior hardware product development, manufacturing engineering, supply chain management, quality systems. Be honest about gaps and your hiring or advisory plan to fill them. Investors look for teams who've shipped physical products before—the challenges of hardware are learned through experience."

          "category": "Demo Reality",
          "question": "How does your demo performance compare to real-world operation?",
          "answer": "Investors are deeply skeptical of robotics demos after seeing many that didn't translate to production. Be brutally honest about the gap between demo and deployment conditions. Explain what's controlled in your demos vs. what varies in production. Show data from pilot deployments in actual customer environments—runtime hours, task completion rates, intervention frequency. The best answer acknowledges the gap while showing you're systematically closing it."

        {
          "category": "Task Success",
          "question": "What is your task success rate in production conditions?",
          "answer": "Task success rate is the critical metric for robotics—the percentage of tasks completed successfully without human intervention. At seed stage, 80-90% in controlled pilots is typical, with path to 95%+ for production viability. Present your success rate with specific conditions: environment complexity, task variety, edge case handling. Show how success rate improves with more deployment data. Be specific about failure modes and your approach to addressing them."
        },

          "category": "Human Intervention",
          "question": "How often does your robot require human intervention and why?",
          "answer": "Intervention rate determines whether your robot creates value or just shifts work. Present interventions per hour or per task with categorization: navigation failures, manipulation failures, edge cases, safety stops. Show intervention rate trajectory as you gather more data and improve the system. Address the cost of intervention in customer economics—if intervention is frequent, the ROI case falls apart."

          "category": "Deployment Complexity",
          "question": "How long does it take to deploy at a new site and what's required?",
          "answer": "Deployment friction kills robotics businesses. Present your deployment process: site assessment, installation time, training period, go-live timeline. Show what customer involvement is required. Compare to competitors or industry benchmarks. The goal is demonstrating that deployment is manageable—not a custom integration project each time. Show how deployment time decreases with experience."

          "category": "Hardware Strategy",
          "question": "What's your hardware strategy—build custom vs. integrate existing platforms?",
          "answer": "Hardware strategy significantly impacts capital intensity and time-to-market. Custom hardware provides differentiation but requires more capital and development time. Integrating existing platforms (mobile bases, arms, sensors) accelerates development but may limit capabilities. Present your approach with clear rationale. Address how strategy evolves as you scale. Show you understand the trade-offs and have made a deliberate choice."

          "category": "Safety Framework",
          "question": "How do you ensure safety when operating around humans?",
          "answer": "Safety is non-negotiable in robotics, especially for human-proximate operation. Present your safety framework: sensing, prediction, reactive behaviors, fail-safes. Show your safety testing methodology and results. Address relevant safety standards (ISO 10218, ISO 13849) and compliance status. Include any safety certifications or third-party validation. Safety failures can end a robotics company—show you take it seriously."

          "category": "Customer ROI",
          "question": "What's the customer ROI and how long until payback?",
          "answer": "Robots must deliver clear economic value. Present customer ROI analysis: labor costs replaced or augmented, productivity improvements, quality gains. Show payback period on robot investment—ideally under 18-24 months. Include total cost of ownership: robot cost, deployment, maintenance, support. Reference customer validation of ROI claims. Economic value must be compelling enough to overcome adoption friction."

          "category": "Technical Moat",
          "question": "What's technically differentiated about your approach?",
          "answer": "Robotics technical differentiation can come from many sources: perception algorithms, motion planning, manipulation skills, learning systems, domain-specific optimization. Explain your technical advantage specifically—not generic AI claims. Show why this advantage is durable. Address whether your approach scales with data (learning effects) or requires manual engineering for each environment. Investors want to understand your technical wedge."

          "category": "Market Focus",
          "question": "Why did you choose this market and application?",
          "answer": "Robotics companies succeed by deeply solving specific problems before generalizing. Explain your market choice: why this application is good for robotics, why it's good for your team, why timing is right. Show deep understanding of customer workflows and pain points. Address market size realistically—robotics markets are often smaller than software. Demonstrate you're building a wedge that can expand."

          "category": "Team Experience",
          "question": "What robotics deployment experience does your team have?",

Highlight team backgrounds in robotics specifically—this is different from general software engineering. Show prior robotics products shipped or deployed. Address gaps with hiring plan or advisors. Investors value teams who've seen robots fail in the field and learned from it."

          "question": "What's your current CAC:LTV ratio and path to 3:1?",
          "answer": "At seed stage, investors expect you to understand your unit economics even if they're not yet optimized. Break down your Customer Acquisition Cost by channel (paid, organic, sales-led) and explain your assumptions for Lifetime Value based on current churn rates and expansion revenue. Most seed SaaS companies show CAC:LTV between 1:1 and 2:1, with a clear plan to reach 3:1+ through improved retention, pricing optimization, or channel efficiency. Show your cohort analysis if available—even 3-6 months of data demonstrates analytical rigor and gives investors confidence in your trajectory."

If retention is below benchmarks (85%+ monthly for SMB, 95%+ for enterprise), explain what you've learned about why customers leave and your specific initiatives to improve. Show you understand the difference between product issues, fit issues, and support issues. The best answers demonstrate deep customer understanding: 'Our churn is primarily in month 2-3 among companies under 20 employees who don't integrate with their CRM. We're addressing this with improved onboarding and a Salesforce integration shipping next month.'"

          "answer": "Present your customer acquisition strategy with channel-by-channel breakdown. Whether you're sales-led, product-led, or marketing-led, show early evidence that your primary channel works. Address CAC by channel and efficiency trends. For product-led growth, show activation and conversion metrics. For sales-led, show pipeline and conversion rates. Investors want to see a repeatable motion emerging—even if it's early—and evidence you can scale it with capital. Be honest about what's working and what's experimental."

          "category": "Product-Market Fit",
          "question": "How do you know you have product-market fit?",
          "answer": "Product-market fit is hard to measure precisely, but strong signals include: organic growth and word-of-mouth referrals, customers who use the product repeatedly without prompting, low churn in your target segment, customers who expand their usage over time, and qualitative feedback indicating the product is essential. Present your evidence across multiple dimensions. The 'Sean Ellis test' (would customers be disappointed if the product went away?) is useful but not sufficient alone. Show patterns in customer behavior that indicate genuine pull."

          "answer": "Walk through your pricing methodology: did you test different price points, analyze willingness to pay, benchmark competitors? Show your current ARPU and explain expansion revenue potential. Most seed SaaS companies are underpriced—explain if you believe that's true for you and how you might address it. Present your pricing structure (per seat, usage-based, tiered) and why it aligns with customer value. Address any pricing friction you've observed in sales conversations."
        },

          "category": "Competition",
          "question": "How do you compete against established players and well-funded startups?",
          "answer": "SaaS markets are usually competitive. Present your competitive positioning honestly: where you win, where you lose, and why. Avoid the trap of claiming you have no competitors or that you're better in every dimension. Show your specific differentiation: is it product capabilities, market focus, pricing, or distribution? Reference actual competitive situations—wins and losses—and what you learned. Investors value founders who understand their competitive landscape deeply and have made deliberate positioning choices."

          "category": "Technical Moat",
          "question": "What's defensible about your product beyond execution speed?",
          "answer": "Speed to market is valuable but not a moat. Explain what becomes harder to replicate over time: proprietary data that improves with usage, network effects, deep integrations with customer systems, workflow embedding that increases switching costs, or specialized domain expertise encoded in the product. The best SaaS companies build compounding advantages—show how your product becomes more valuable and more defensible as you grow. Be specific about what a well-funded competitor couldn't replicate in 18 months."

          "category": "Market Size",
          "question": "How big is your market and how do you size it?",
          "answer": "Present bottom-up market sizing that investors can validate. Start with your target customer profile: how many exist, what they pay for adjacent solutions, what your solution is worth to them. Calculate your serviceable addressable market before jumping to TAM. Explain your expansion path from initial wedge to broader market. Reference comparable SaaS companies' market sizes where relevant. Top-down TAM numbers get discounted heavily—show you understand your specific entry point and expansion trajectory."

          "category": "Team",
          "question": "Why is this team positioned to win in this market?",
          "answer": "Explain your team's relevant advantages: domain expertise, technical capabilities, prior startup experience, or unique insights into the customer problem. Be honest about gaps and how you plan to fill them. For SaaS, investors often look for commercial DNA (sales/marketing leadership) alongside technical founders—address whether you have this or plan to add it. Show evidence of ability to recruit: early hires, advisors, or committed candidates. Team is often the primary bet at seed stage."

          "answer": "Present 3-5 concrete milestones this capital achieves: typically a mix of product (feature launches, platform capabilities), commercial (ARR targets, customer logos, NRR benchmarks), and team (key hires) goals. Show you understand what Series A investors in your space typically require—usually $1-3M ARR, strong retention, and a repeatable go-to-market motion. Explain the logical sequence of milestones and how they de-risk the business. Be realistic about timeline—most seed companies take 18-24 months to Series A."
