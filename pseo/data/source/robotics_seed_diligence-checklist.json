  "title": "Robotics Seed diligence checklist",
  "summary": "Robotics seed diligence focuses on real-world performance validation and team capability. Investors will request pilot deployment data and customer references. Prepare comprehensive documentation on robot performance, safety, and deployment process. Pitchchat keeps diligence docs organized and easy to review.",
  "items": [
    {
      "item": "Pilot deployment data with performance metrics",
      "rationale": "Detailed data from customer pilots: task success rates, intervention frequency, runtime hours, failure analysis. Be prepared to show raw performance logs and demonstrate performance claims."
    },
    {
      "item": "Robot demonstration in production-like conditions",
      "rationale": "Live or video demonstration in realistic conditions—not a controlled lab setup. Investors may request to observe pilots at customer sites."
