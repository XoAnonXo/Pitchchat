  "title": "AI Seed diligence checklist",
  "summary": "AI seed-stage diligence focuses on technical differentiation, data rights, and team capability. Investors will probe deeply on defensibility against foundation model providers and the sustainability of your technical approach. Prepare documentation and clear answers for each area below.

  "items": [
    {
      "item": "Model Architecture & Training Documentation",
      "rationale": "Technical diligence will examine your approach. Prepare clear documentation of your model architecture, training methodology, and how it differs from fine-tuning commodity models. Be ready to explain trade-offs and technical decisions."

    {
      "item": "Data Rights & Provenance Audit",
      "rationale": "With increasing litigation around training data, investors need confidence in your data rights. Document sources, licenses, consent mechanisms, and any potential copyright or privacy exposure. Clean data provenance is increasingly a dealbreaker."

      "rationale": "Prepare three to five customers willing to speak with investors. Choose customers who can speak to the problem severity, your product value, and their willingness to pay and expand. Brief customers on likely questions."
    },
    {
      "item": "Security & Compliance Documentation",
      "rationale": "If targeting enterprise customers, document your security practices and any compliance certifications. SOC 2 Type II may not be complete at seed stage but have a clear roadmap. Address data handling and privacy practices."

    {
      "item": "IP & Patent Strategy",
      "rationale": "Document any patents filed or in preparation. More importantly, be prepared to discuss your broader IP strategy and how you protect your technical advantages. In AI, trade secrets and data often matter more than patents."
