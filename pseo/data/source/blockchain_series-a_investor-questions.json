  "title": "Investor questions for Blockchain Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A blockchain companies must demonstrate product-market fit with sustainable economics—not just growth fueled by token incentives. Investors evaluate protocol revenue, organic user retention, and defensible competitive position. The bar has risen significantly post-crypto winter: real revenue and proven utility are now required, not just impressive TVL or user counts. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Sustainable Economics",
      "question": "What's your protocol revenue and path to profitability without relying on token emissions?",
      "answer": "Series A blockchain companies must show real revenue traction. Present protocol revenue: fee generation, revenue per user, revenue growth trajectory. Show unit economics that work without token subsidies. Address how revenue sustains operations as token emissions decrease. Present path to protocol profitability. Investors need confidence in sustainable economics—token appreciation is not a business model."
    },
    {
      "category": "Organic Retention",
      "question": "What's your user retention after token incentives decrease or end?",
      "answer": "The true test of product-market fit is retention without incentives. Show user behavior when incentives reduce: retention rates, usage patterns, migration rates. Present cohort analysis distinguishing organic users from incentive-driven. Show what percentage of TVL or volume is 'sticky.' Address your incentive reduction roadmap and expected impact. Organic retention proves real utility."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Moat",
      "question": "How defensible is your protocol against forks, competitors, and new entrants?",
      "answer": "Blockchain protocols can be forked easily—what makes yours defensible? Present your moat: network effects, liquidity depth, integrations, developer ecosystem, brand, or technical differentiation. Show competitive dynamics: why users don't switch, what makes forking ineffective. Address any vampire attacks or competitive migrations. Demonstrate increasing returns to scale that protect your position."
    },
    {
      "category": "Regulatory Progress",
      "question": "What's your regulatory status and how have you de-risked compliance?",
      "answer": "Series A requires significant regulatory progress. Show compliance infrastructure built: licenses obtained, registrations completed, legal structure optimized. Present relationships with regulators and any formal guidance received. Address SEC, CFTC, and state requirements for US. For international, show MiCA readiness and key jurisdiction compliance. Regulatory de-risking should be measurable progress, not just legal opinions."
    },
    {
      "category": "Token Value Accrual",
      "question": "How does value accrue to token holders and what's the treasury management strategy?",
      "answer": "Token value should reflect protocol success. Present your value accrual mechanism: fee distribution, buybacks, staking returns, or governance value. Show treasury management: composition, policies, and runway. Address any token emissions and their sustainability. Include vesting schedules and unlock impact. Sophisticated investors understand tokenomics—demonstrate yours create aligned incentives."
    },
    {
      "category": "Security Track Record",
      "question": "What's your security track record and how has your security posture matured?",
      "answer": "Series A protocols should have established security credibility. Present your track record: any incidents, response effectiveness, funds at risk vs. recovered. Show security evolution: additional audits, bug bounty results, security team growth. Include insurance coverage and coverage limits. Address any smart contract upgrades and migration security. Security track record builds trust with institutional users."
    },
    {
      "category": "Decentralization Progress",
      "question": "How has decentralization progressed and what's the governance participation rate?",
      "answer": "Series A should show meaningful decentralization progress. Present governance evolution: decision-making distribution, admin key status, upgrade mechanisms. Show participation metrics: voter turnout, proposal activity, delegate diversity. Address remaining centralization and timeline for removal. Demonstrate decentralization is real, not theater. Include any regulatory benefits from genuine decentralization."
    },
    {
      "category": "Enterprise & Institutional",
      "question": "What enterprise or institutional adoption have you achieved?",
      "answer": "Enterprise and institutional users validate protocol maturity. Present institutional adoption: large users, enterprise integrations, institutional TVL. Show what requirements they imposed: security, compliance, SLAs. Address enterprise sales motion and pipeline. Include any partnerships with traditional finance or tech companies. Institutional adoption signals protocol readiness for scale."
    },
    {
      "category": "Cross-chain Strategy",
      "question": "What's your multi-chain or cross-chain strategy as the ecosystem evolves?",
      "answer": "Blockchain landscape continues fragmenting across L1s and L2s. Present your multi-chain approach: deployments across chains, bridging strategy, liquidity fragmentation management. Show chain selection rationale and competitive dynamics across ecosystems. Address any chain-specific risks or opportunities. Demonstrate strategic thinking about ecosystem evolution."
    },
    {
      "category": "Exit Path",
      "question": "What are realistic exit scenarios for blockchain investments?",
      "answer": "Blockchain exits differ from traditional venture. Present realistic scenarios: strategic acquisition by exchange, fintech, or tech company; M&A within crypto; or potential token liquidity events. Reference comparable transactions and valuations. Address how your structure (token vs. equity) affects exit options. Show strategic interest you've attracted. Investors need to see liquidity path—demonstrate thoughtful planning."
