  "title": "Investor questions for Robotics Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A robotics companies must demonstrate production-grade reliability and a scalable deployment model. Investors evaluate whether you've solved the demo-to-production challenge and can scale customer deployments efficiently. The bar has risen—Series A now requires proven performance metrics from significant deployment hours and a clear path to positive unit economics. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Production Performance",
      "question": "What's your task success rate across your deployed fleet?",
      "answer": "Series A robotics companies should achieve 95%+ task success rates in production. Present fleet-wide performance data: aggregate success rate, distribution across sites, improvement trajectory. Show how success rate varies by task type, environment complexity, or site maturity. Address outlier sites with lower performance and your approach to improvement. Fleet-wide data is more credible than cherry-picked sites."
    },
    {
      "category": "Fleet Operations",
      "question": "How do you manage and support your deployed fleet?",
      "answer": "Scaling robotics requires fleet management capability. Present your operations infrastructure: remote monitoring, diagnostic capabilities, intervention support, software updates. Show metrics: support tickets per robot, remote resolution rate, average downtime. Include your team structure for supporting the fleet. Demonstrate you can support 10x more robots without proportional team scaling."
    },
    {
      "category": "Deployment Scalability",
      "question": "How have you systematized deployment and what's the timeline now?",
      "answer": "Series A should show deployment process maturity. Present current deployment timeline vs. early pilots—should be significantly improved. Show the systematization: playbooks, tooling, customer onboarding process. Include deployment success rate and common issues. Address how deployment scales with team size. Your deployment model is as important as your robot capability."
    },
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics",
      "question": "What are your unit economics and how do they improve with scale?",
      "answer": "Robotics unit economics include hardware margin, deployment costs, and ongoing support costs. Present current economics with trajectory: hardware gross margin, fully-loaded cost per deployment, support cost per robot. Show how economics improve with fleet scale. For RaaS models, show customer unit economics including churn. Investors need confidence that scaling improves—not just grows—the business."
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Retention",
      "question": "What's your customer retention and expansion pattern?",
      "answer": "Customer retention proves the robot delivers lasting value. Present retention metrics: customer churn, robot utilization over time, expansion within accounts. Show why customers retain: ROI realization, integration depth, switching costs. For expansion, show pattern of customers adding robots or sites. Long-term customer relationships indicate product-market fit in robotics."
    },
    {
      "category": "Market Penetration",
      "question": "How are you penetrating your target market and what's the growth trajectory?",
      "answer": "Series A should show market traction beyond early adopters. Present your customer base: number of customers, fleet size, market segment distribution. Show growth trajectory and pipeline. Address how you're reaching customers: direct sales, partners, word-of-mouth. Include win/loss analysis against alternatives. Demonstrate you're building a sales motion that can scale."
    },
    {
      "category": "Manufacturing & Hardware",
      "question": "How will you scale hardware production to meet demand?",
      "answer": "Growing robot fleet requires production capability. Present your hardware strategy: in-house vs. CM, current capacity, scaling plan. Show hardware cost trajectory with volume. Address supply chain maturity and risks. Include quality metrics from production. Demonstrate you can build robots at the rate you need to sell them."
    },
    {
      "category": "Technology Roadmap",
      "question": "How does your technology evolve to expand capabilities and markets?",
      "answer": "Robotics platforms should expand over time. Present your technology roadmap: new capabilities, expanded task types, new environments. Show how you leverage deployed fleet data for improvement. Include next-generation hardware plans if relevant. Address how roadmap enables market expansion while maintaining focus. Show you're building a platform, not a point solution."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competition",
      "question": "How do you win against competitors and potential large company entrants?",
      "answer": "Robotics markets attract attention from large companies. Present competitive positioning: where you win, why customers choose you, competitive moat. Show win/loss data against specific competitors. Address the threat of Amazon, Google, or major automation players entering your space. Your answer should demonstrate durable differentiation, not just current features."
    },
    {
      "category": "Path to Profitability",
      "question": "What's the path to profitability and how much capital is required?",
      "answer": "Robotics is capital-intensive—investors need to see the path to self-sustaining economics. Present your profitability model: scale required, margin improvement trajectory, operating leverage. Show capital required to reach profitability. Include scenario analysis: faster growth requiring more capital vs. capital-efficient path. Demonstrate you understand the journey and have a realistic plan."
