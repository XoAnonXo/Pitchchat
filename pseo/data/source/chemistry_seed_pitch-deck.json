  "title": "Pitch deck outline for Chemistry Seed startups",
  "summary": "Seed-stage biotech pitch decks must establish scientific credibility while demonstrating commercial potential. Lead with the problem and your differentiated approach. Science should be compelling but accessible. Address regulatory and manufacturing early—these separate serious biotechs from science projects. Pitchchat turns your deck into an interactive pitch room for investors.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Problem & Unmet Need",
      "goal": "Establish the medical need your science addresses",
      "guidance": "Present the disease or condition with patient impact. Show treatment landscape gaps: what's available, why it fails, what patients need. Include market sizing but focus on unmet need. Use patient stories if available. The problem should be significant and underserved."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scientific Approach",
      "goal": "Present your differentiated science accessibly",
      "guidance": "Explain your mechanism of action clearly—even for complex science. Show what's novel and why it should work. Include key data supporting your hypothesis. Make it understandable to generalist investors while maintaining scientific rigor. Differentiation should be clear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Preclinical Data",
      "goal": "Show evidence supporting your approach",
      "guidance": "Present your strongest data: in-vitro, in-vivo, any clinical signals. Include efficacy, safety, and pharmacology data as available. Show data quality and reproducibility. Address limitations honestly. This slide proves you're beyond hypothesis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Development Plan",
      "goal": "Show clear path to next milestone",
      "guidance": "Present development roadmap with key milestones. Include IND-enabling studies, clinical plans if applicable. Show what this capital achieves. Address dependencies and risk mitigation. Timeline should be realistic with contingencies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Regulatory Strategy",
      "goal": "Demonstrate regulatory pathway clarity",

    {
      "title": "Competitive Landscape",
      "goal": "Position against alternatives in development",
      "guidance": "Map competitive landscape: approved products, clinical-stage programs, other preclinical efforts. Show your differentiation clearly. Address both efficacy and development risk comparisons. Demonstrate awareness of competitive dynamics."
    },
    {
      "title": "Team",
      "goal": "Show drug development capability",
      "guidance": "Present team with relevant experience highlighted. Show therapeutic area expertise and regulatory experience. Include scientific advisors and their involvement. Address gaps with hiring plans. Team credibility is essential in biotech."
