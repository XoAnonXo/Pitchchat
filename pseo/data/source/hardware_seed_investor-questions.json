  "title": "Investor questions for Hardware Seed startups",
  "summary": "Seed-stage hardware startups face unique investor scrutiny around manufacturing feasibility, unit economics at scale, and the capital intensity of physical product development. Investors evaluate your Bill of Materials trajectory, First Pass Yield on prototypes, and realistic timelines to production. Hardware is hard—demonstrating you understand the manufacturing challenges is as important as the technology itself. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Manufacturing Readiness",
      "question": "What's your current BOM cost and path to target production cost?",
      "answer": "Hardware economics live or die by Bill of Materials trajectory. At seed stage, prototype BOM is typically 2-5x eventual production cost. Investors want to see: current BOM breakdown by component, identified cost reduction opportunities (volume pricing, component redesign, supplier negotiations), and realistic timeline to target cost. Show you understand the cost drivers and have a specific plan, not just assumptions that 'volume will fix it.'"
    },
    {
      "category": "Production Quality",
      "question": "What's your First Pass Yield and how do you plan to improve it?",
      "answer": "First Pass Yield—the percentage of units that pass testing without rework—indicates manufacturing maturity. Seed-stage companies often see 60-70% FPY on early prototypes, targeting 90%+ for production. Present your current FPY with root cause analysis for failures. Show your quality improvement roadmap: design for manufacturability changes, process improvements, and testing refinements. Investors understand FPY improves but want evidence you're systematically addressing it."
    },
    {
      "category": "Supply Chain",
      "question": "How resilient is your supply chain and what are the critical dependencies?",
      "answer": "Hardware supply chains have proven fragile. Identify your critical components: single-source dependencies, long lead-time items, and components with supply risk. Show your mitigation strategy: dual-sourcing plans, inventory buffering, or design alternatives. Investors have been burned by supply chain surprises—demonstrate you've mapped risks and have contingency plans. Reference any supplier relationships or commitments."
    },
    {
      "category": "Design Maturity",
      "question": "How many design iterations to production-ready and what's the timeline?",
      "answer": "Hardware iteration cycles are long and expensive. Present your design maturity: current prototype generation, known issues, and planned iterations. Show your engineering change order (ECO) rate trending down as you approach production readiness. Include certification requirements (UL, FCC, CE) and their timeline. Investors want to see a realistic path to design freeze with contingency for discoveries."
    },
    {
      "category": "Capital Intensity",
      "question": "How much capital do you need to reach production scale and positive unit economics?",
      "answer": "Hardware is capital-intensive by nature. Map your funding requirements through production scale: tooling investment, initial inventory, working capital for production ramp. Be honest about total capital needs—hardware founders often underestimate. Show your funding strategy including non-dilutive sources (Kickstarter, grants, strategic investment). Investors appreciate founders who've done the real math on hardware capital requirements."
    },
    {
      "category": "Manufacturing Strategy",
      "question": "Will you manufacture in-house or use contract manufacturing, and why?",
      "answer": "Manufacturing strategy significantly impacts capital needs and control. Present your approach with clear rationale: contract manufacturing reduces capital but limits control; in-house provides quality control but requires facility investment. For CM approach, show your supplier evaluation and relationship development. For in-house, show facility plans and equipment requirements. Address how the strategy might evolve with scale."
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Validation",
      "question": "What evidence do you have that customers will pay your target price?",
      "answer": "Hardware pricing is constrained by BOM plus margin targets. Validate that your target price works in the market: customer interviews, pilot pricing tests, competitive positioning. Show willingness-to-pay research and how it maps to your cost structure. For B2B hardware, include ROI analysis customers have validated. Investors have seen too many hardware startups with great technology but unworkable economics."
    },
    {
      "category": "Certification & Compliance",
      "question": "What certifications are required and what's your compliance timeline?",
      "answer": "Hardware certifications (UL, FCC, CE, industry-specific) are often gating to sales. Map your certification requirements with realistic timelines and costs. Show any preliminary testing or pre-certification work completed. Include regulatory compliance requirements for your target markets. Certification delays are common—show you've planned appropriately and built buffer into your timeline."
    },
    {
      "category": "Field Performance",
      "question": "How have prototypes performed in real-world conditions?",
      "answer": "Field testing reveals issues that lab testing misses. Present your field deployment experience: number of units deployed, environments tested, runtime accumulated. Show failure mode data and how you've addressed issues discovered. Include customer feedback from pilot users. If limited field data, acknowledge it and present your validation plan. Investors want evidence the product works outside the lab."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team Capability",
      "question": "Does your team have the hardware development and manufacturing experience needed?",
      "answer": "Hardware teams need different skills than software teams. Highlight relevant experience: prior hardware product development, manufacturing engineering, supply chain management, quality systems. Be honest about gaps and your hiring or advisory plan to fill them. Investors look for teams who've shipped physical products before—the challenges of hardware are learned through experience."
