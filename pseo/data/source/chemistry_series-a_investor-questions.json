  "title": "Investor questions for Chemistry Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A biotech companies must demonstrate clinical-stage readiness or significant preclinical de-risking. Investors evaluate the strength of your data package, regulatory clarity, and ability to execute clinical trials. The bar has risen—Series A now typically requires IND-enabling data or early clinical results, with a clear path to meaningful clinical milestones. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Clinical Data",
      "question": "What clinical or late-stage preclinical data supports your approach?",
      "answer": "Series A biotech should have substantial data. Present your data package: IND-enabling studies completed, Phase 1 safety data if in clinic, or robust preclinical efficacy. Show data quality: study design, statistical power, reproducibility. Address how data de-risks the program vs. competitors. Include any biomarker or translational data supporting human efficacy. This is the core of Series A biotech valuation."
    },
    {
      "category": "Clinical Development Plan",
      "question": "What's your clinical development plan and timeline to key milestones?",
      "answer": "Series A should have detailed clinical plans. Present your development strategy: Phase 1 design (if not completed), Phase 2 trial design, patient population, endpoints. Show regulatory alignment on design. Include timeline with dependencies and risk factors. Address patient recruitment strategy and site selection. Clinical execution capability is critical at this stage."
    },
    {
      "category": "Regulatory Status",
      "question": "What's your regulatory status and what guidance have you received?",
      "answer": "Series A biotechs should have meaningful regulatory interactions. Present FDA meeting outcomes: pre-IND feedback, Type B meeting minutes, special designations obtained. Show how regulatory feedback shaped development plans. Address any regulatory concerns raised and your response. Include international regulatory strategy if relevant. Regulatory alignment significantly de-risks clinical development."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Position",
      "question": "How do you differentiate against clinical-stage competitors?",
      "answer": "At Series A, competitive dynamics are clearer. Present competitive landscape with clinical-stage programs. Show your differentiation: mechanism, efficacy expectations, safety profile, patient convenience. Include head-to-head data if available or planned. Address competitive programs that have failed and implications. Your positioning should be specific and data-supported, not just aspirational."
    },
    {
      "category": "Manufacturing Readiness",
      "question": "How ready is your manufacturing for clinical supply and commercial scale?",
      "answer": "Series A requires manufacturing maturity. Present your CMC status: process locked, analytical methods validated, stability data. Show CMO relationships and capacity commitments. Address scale-up challenges and timelines. Include cost trajectory toward commercial manufacturing. For biologics especially, manufacturing is often rate-limiting. Demonstrate you won't be held back by CMC."
    },
    {
      "category": "Partnership Interest",
      "question": "What pharma partnership interest have you generated and what's your strategy?",
      "answer": "Series A biotechs often attract partnership interest. Present pharma engagement: confidentiality agreements, diligence processes, term sheet discussions if applicable. Show what data or milestones make you optimally partnership-ready. Address deal structure preferences: geography, indication, development stage splits. Include competitive dynamics among potential partners. Partnership optionality provides downside protection."
    },
    {
      "category": "IP Strength",
      "question": "How has your IP position strengthened and what's the competitive moat?",
      "answer": "Series A should show IP maturation. Present portfolio evolution: new filings, prosecuted claims, granted patents. Show patent term relative to development timeline—will you have adequate protection at launch? Include any competitive IP challenges or FTO updates. Address data exclusivity strategy as complement to patents. Comprehensive IP creates sustainable competitive advantage."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team Execution",
      "question": "How has your team demonstrated execution capability?",
      "answer": "Series A evaluates track record since seed. Present execution evidence: milestones achieved, timelines met, data quality delivered. Show team evolution: key hires that strengthened capability. Include any pivots and how they were managed. Address board composition and strategic support. Execution track record predicts future performance."
    },
    {
      "category": "Capital Efficiency",
      "question": "How efficiently have you deployed capital and what's required to reach key milestones?",
      "answer": "Series A evaluates capital efficiency. Present achievement per dollar of seed capital: data generated, regulatory progress, team built. Show this round's milestone targets and capital required. Include scenario analysis: faster timeline requiring more capital vs. capital-efficient path. Address total capital to approval or partnership milestone. Capital efficiency matters even for large biotech raises."
    },
    {
      "category": "Exit Scenarios",
      "question": "What are realistic exit scenarios and comparable transactions?",
      "answer": "Series A investors need liquidity visibility. Present exit scenarios: acquisition at clinical milestones, later-stage acquisition, or IPO path. Reference comparable transactions with valuations and timing. Show strategic buyer landscape and any expressed interest. Address therapeutic area M&A activity trends. Your path to liquidity should be specific and evidence-based."

      "response": "Address safety signals directly and scientifically. Present the signal in context: incidence, severity, management, resolution. Show how it compares to approved therapies in the class. Include regulatory feedback if available. Present dose optimization or patient selection strategies that may mitigate. Safety signals aren't necessarily fatal—transparent discussion and mitigation plans matter."

    {
      "objection": "Pharma companies have internal programs here—why would they acquire rather than compete?",
      "response": "Present pharma program landscape with differentiation. Show timeline advantages: your asset may be further along or better positioned. Address synergy opportunities with pharma portfolios. Reference build-vs-buy decisions pharma has made in similar situations. Include any pharma interest that validates acquisition thesis. Pharma programs don't preclude acquisition—they often enable it."
