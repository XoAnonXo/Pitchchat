  "summary": "Seed-stage robotics metrics focus on real-world performance, not lab capabilities. Investors evaluate task success rates in production conditions, deployment scalability, and customer economics. These benchmarks demonstrate whether your robot actually works outside the lab. Pitchchat keeps fundraising metrics investor-ready in one room.",
