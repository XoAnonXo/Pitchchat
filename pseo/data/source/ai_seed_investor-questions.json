  "title": "Investor questions for AI Seed startups",
  "summary": "Seed-stage AI founders face intense scrutiny about technical defensibility, especially in a market where foundation models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google dominate headlines. Investors want to understand how your startup creates lasting value beyond being an API wrapper. Prepare to articulate your unique data advantages, model architecture innovations, and path to sustainable unit economics at scale. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Technical Moat",
      "question": "How defensible is your AI against OpenAI, Google, and other foundation model providers entering your space?",
      "answer": "Investors hear this concern constantly in AI deals. Your answer should focus on defensibility layers: proprietary training data that would take years to replicate, domain-specific fine-tuning that requires deep expertise, unique data flywheels where user interactions improve your model, or workflow integration that creates switching costs. Avoid claiming your prompt engineering is a moat. Instead, show how your approach compounds value over time in ways that big tech cannot easily replicate with scale alone."
    },
    {
      "category": "Data Strategy",
      "question": "What is your data moat and how do you ensure you have rights to your training data?",
      "answer": "Data provenance is now a legal and competitive battleground. Explain where your training data comes from, whether you have explicit licenses or consent, and how you handle potential copyright or privacy issues. The best answers show proprietary data sources: first-party user data with clear consent, partnerships with data owners, or synthetic data generation capabilities. Investors want to avoid companies that could face lawsuits or lose access to critical training data."
    },
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics",
      "question": "What are your inference costs and how do they scale with usage?",
      "answer": "AI startups often underestimate compute costs. Walk through your current cost per inference, how that changes at 10x and 100x scale, and your strategy for cost reduction. This might include model distillation, quantization, custom hardware, or architectural optimizations. Show you understand the path from current margins (which may be negative) to sustainable unit economics. Investors have seen too many AI companies with impressive demos but broken economics."
    },
    {
      "category": "Product Differentiation",
      "question": "Why can't a customer just use ChatGPT or Claude directly instead of your product?",
      "answer": "This is the 'wrapper company' objection. Your answer should articulate value beyond the base model: specialized domain knowledge, proprietary workflows, data integrations the customer needs, compliance and security requirements, or dramatically better UX for a specific use case. The strongest answers show that even if the underlying model commoditizes, your product layer remains valuable because of how it solves the complete customer problem."
    },
    {
      "category": "Go-to-Market",
      "question": "How are you acquiring customers and what does your sales motion look like?",
      "answer": "At seed stage, investors want to see evidence of repeatable customer acquisition. Describe your primary channel (product-led growth, outbound sales, partnerships), your customer acquisition cost, and early signs of repeatability. For enterprise AI, explain your champion-building strategy and how you navigate procurement. For prosumer or SMB, show activation and retention metrics. The goal is demonstrating you understand how to find and convert your target customer efficiently."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team",
      "question": "What is your team's specific AI/ML expertise and track record?",
      "answer": "AI investing is still somewhat team-driven given rapid technical change. Highlight relevant ML publications, experience at top AI labs or companies, successful AI products shipped, or deep domain expertise in your target vertical. If your team lacks traditional ML credentials, explain your compensating strengths: perhaps you are domain experts who have assembled strong technical advisors, or you have a track record of rapid technical learning and execution."
    },
    {
      "category": "Market Timing",
      "question": "Why is now the right time for this AI application?",
      "answer": "Timing matters enormously in AI given how fast the field moves. Explain what has changed recently that makes your approach newly viable: perhaps new model capabilities, dropping inference costs, regulatory clarity, or shifting customer willingness to adopt AI. Show you understand the technology evolution curve and why your solution is possible and necessary today when it was not two years ago."
    },
    {
      "category": "Regulatory Risk",
      "question": "How do you think about AI regulation and compliance requirements?",
      "answer": "With the EU AI Act, potential US regulations, and industry-specific requirements emerging, investors need to understand your regulatory exposure. Explain which regulatory frameworks apply to your use case, how you are building compliance into your product, and whether regulation might actually benefit you by raising barriers to entry. Show awareness of risks like algorithmic bias, explainability requirements, and data privacy obligations."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competition",
      "question": "Who are your main competitors and how do you differentiate?",
      "answer": "Map the competitive landscape honestly: other startups, incumbents adding AI features, and potential big tech entry. For each category, explain your differentiation. Avoid claiming you have no competitors, as investors view this skeptically. The best answers show you have studied alternatives deeply and can articulate specific advantages: faster time-to-value, better accuracy on target use cases, stronger integrations, or more suitable pricing for your segment."
    },
    {
      "category": "Vision",
      "question": "What is the long-term vision and how big can this become?",
      "answer": "Seed investors need to see a path to a large outcome. Paint a picture of where this goes: from initial wedge to platform, from one use case to many, from one vertical to horizontal expansion. Ground this in realistic market sizing for your initial beachhead, then show how success there unlocks larger opportunities. Avoid hand-wavy claims about AI transforming everything. Instead, show a logical expansion path with clear milestones."

  "objections": [
    {
      "objection": "This looks like a thin wrapper on top of OpenAI's API. What happens when they add this feature?",
      "response": "Acknowledge the risk directly, then explain your defensibility layers. This might include proprietary data pipelines that improve model performance for your specific use case, deep workflow integration that would require significant effort to replicate, compliance and security features enterprise customers require, or network effects where user activity improves the product for everyone. Show you have thought carefully about the platform risk and have a strategy beyond hoping OpenAI does not compete."
    },
    {
      "objection": "AI inference costs seem unsustainable. How do you get to positive unit economics?",
      "response": "Walk through your current cost structure and your path to profitability. This might involve model distillation to reduce compute requirements, architectural optimizations, batching strategies, or pricing adjustments as you prove value. Reference specific technical approaches and provide a timeline for when you expect to achieve target margins. Show you understand the problem deeply and have concrete plans, not just hope that costs will magically decrease."
    },
    {
      "objection": "The AI space is moving so fast. How do you avoid being disrupted by the next model breakthrough?",
      "response": "This is a valid concern given rapid progress in foundation models. Your answer should focus on what remains durable even as underlying models improve: your unique data assets, customer relationships, workflow integration, domain expertise, and brand in your vertical. Show how you architect your system to benefit from model improvements rather than being displaced by them. The best AI companies become better as models improve, not obsolete."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Your team does not have PhD-level ML research credentials. Can you really compete technically?",
      "response": "Many successful AI companies are built by strong engineers and domain experts rather than researchers. Explain your team's relevant strengths: deep understanding of the customer problem, ability to ship product quickly, domain expertise that guides model application, or strong technical advisors who provide research guidance. Show you know what you do not know and have strategies to fill gaps. Execution often matters more than pure research pedigree in applied AI."
