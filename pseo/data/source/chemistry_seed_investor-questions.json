  "title": "Investor questions for Chemistry Seed startups",
  "summary": "Seed-stage chemistry and biotech startups face rigorous scientific validation requirements alongside commercial viability assessment. Investors evaluate the strength of your scientific foundation, regulatory pathway clarity, and team's ability to navigate long development timelines. The biotech funding environment has shifted toward proof-of-concept data—investors want to see de-risked science before committing significant capital. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Scientific Validation",
      "question": "What scientific evidence supports your approach and how differentiated is your science?",
      "answer": "Seed biotech requires compelling scientific rationale. Present your scientific foundation: mechanism of action, preclinical data, any in-vivo results. Show differentiation from existing approaches—what's novel about your science? Include publications, patents, or key opinion leader validation. Address reproducibility of your data. Investors evaluate whether your science represents genuine innovation or incremental improvement. Strong scientific story with supporting data is essential."
    },
    {
      "category": "Development Stage",
      "question": "What's your current development stage and what are the key milestones ahead?",
      "answer": "Be precise about development stage—discovery, lead optimization, preclinical, IND-enabling. Present your data package supporting current stage. Show clear milestones: what data do you need to generate, what decisions does it enable? Include realistic timelines with dependencies identified. Address technical risks at each stage. Investors need to understand where you are and what it takes to reach the next value inflection point."
    },
    {
      "category": "Regulatory Pathway",
      "question": "What's your regulatory strategy and have you engaged with regulators?",
      "answer": "Regulatory strategy should be well-developed even at seed stage. Present your pathway: FDA designation pursued (breakthrough, fast track, orphan), endpoint strategy, precedent products. Show any regulatory interactions: pre-IND meetings, scientific advice, Type B meetings. Address whether your endpoints are validated or require qualification. Include international regulatory considerations if relevant. Clear regulatory thinking demonstrates team sophistication."
    },
    {
      "category": "Intellectual Property",
      "question": "What's your IP position and freedom-to-operate status?",
      "answer": "IP is foundational for biotech value. Present your portfolio: patents filed and granted, composition-of-matter vs. method claims, geographic coverage. Show freedom-to-operate analysis—have you identified blocking patents? Address patent term relative to product lifecycle. Include trade secrets and know-how that complement patents. IP strategy should support both protection and partnership flexibility. Weak IP position significantly limits exit options."
    },
    {
      "category": "Target Selection",
      "question": "Why this target/indication and what's the market opportunity?",
      "answer": "Target and indication selection defines your opportunity. Present the rationale: unmet medical need, patient population, current treatment landscape. Show market size but focus on addressable segments. Include competitive landscape—who else is targeting this? Address why existing treatments fail and how you're differentiated. Show key opinion leader input on target validity. Your indication choice should balance opportunity size with development feasibility."
    },
    {
      "category": "Manufacturing Strategy",
      "question": "How will you manufacture at scale and what's your CMO strategy?",
      "answer": "Manufacturing strategy should be considered early. Present your approach: internal capability vs. CMO partners. Show process development status and scalability path. Address tech transfer complexity and timeline. Include manufacturing risks: yield, cost, quality consistency. For biologics, this is especially critical. Investors have seen too many programs fail at manufacturing scale-up. Demonstrate you're thinking ahead."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team Expertise",
      "question": "What relevant drug development experience does your team have?",
      "answer": "Biotech requires deep domain expertise. Present team backgrounds: prior drug development experience, therapeutic area expertise, regulatory interactions. Show relevant track record—drugs advanced, approvals contributed to, company building experience. Address gaps honestly with plans to fill them. Include scientific advisors and their involvement level. First-time biotech founders with strong industry veterans often perform well."
    },
    {
      "category": "Capital Efficiency",
      "question": "How capital-efficiently can you reach your next milestone?",
      "answer": "Biotech can be capital-efficient with smart milestone design. Present your milestone strategy: what data creates maximum value with minimum capital? Show budget allocation: preclinical studies, manufacturing, team. Address what you're not doing and why—focus is valuable. Include partnership or grant opportunities that extend runway. Demonstrate capital-efficient mindset even if total development cost is high."
    },
    {
      "category": "Partnership Strategy",
      "question": "What's your pharma partnership strategy and timing?",
      "answer": "Most biotech assets partner at some stage. Present your strategy: when to partner, with whom, what terms to optimize for. Show any existing pharma interest or discussions. Address what data package makes you partnership-ready. Include competitive dynamics—are others pursuing similar partnerships? Your partnership strategy should balance value capture with development acceleration."
    },
    {
      "category": "Exit Scenarios",
      "question": "What are realistic exit scenarios for a company at your stage?",
      "answer": "Biotech exits differ by stage and therapeutic area. Present realistic scenarios: acquisition by pharma, merger with public company, or IPO at later stage. Reference comparable transactions with valuations. Address your therapeutic area's M&A activity. Show strategic buyers who might be interested and why. Investors need to see liquidity path—biotech investments are long duration."
