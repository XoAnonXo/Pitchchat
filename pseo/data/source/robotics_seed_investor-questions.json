  "title": "Investor questions for Robotics Seed startups",
  "summary": "Seed-stage robotics startups face unique investor scrutiny around demo-to-deployment reality, task success rates, and the challenge of operating reliably in unstructured real-world environments. Investors have seen countless impressive demos that failed in production. Your job is demonstrating that your robot actually works—not in controlled conditions, but in the messy reality of customer environments. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Demo Reality",
      "question": "How does your demo performance compare to real-world operation?",
      "answer": "Investors are deeply skeptical of robotics demos after seeing many that didn't translate to production. Be brutally honest about the gap between demo and deployment conditions. Explain what's controlled in your demos vs. what varies in production. Show data from pilot deployments in actual customer environments—runtime hours, task completion rates, intervention frequency. The best answer acknowledges the gap while showing you're systematically closing it."
    },
    {
      "category": "Task Success",
      "question": "What is your task success rate in production conditions?",
      "answer": "Task success rate is the critical metric for robotics—the percentage of tasks completed successfully without human intervention. At seed stage, 80-90% in controlled pilots is typical, with path to 95%+ for production viability. Present your success rate with specific conditions: environment complexity, task variety, edge case handling. Show how success rate improves with more deployment data. Be specific about failure modes and your approach to addressing them."
    },
    {
      "category": "Human Intervention",
      "question": "How often does your robot require human intervention and why?",
      "answer": "Intervention rate determines whether your robot creates value or just shifts work. Present interventions per hour or per task with categorization: navigation failures, manipulation failures, edge cases, safety stops. Show intervention rate trajectory as you gather more data and improve the system. Address the cost of intervention in customer economics—if intervention is frequent, the ROI case falls apart."
    },
    {
      "category": "Deployment Complexity",
      "question": "How long does it take to deploy at a new site and what's required?",
      "answer": "Deployment friction kills robotics businesses. Present your deployment process: site assessment, installation time, training period, go-live timeline. Show what customer involvement is required. Compare to competitors or industry benchmarks. The goal is demonstrating that deployment is manageable—not a custom integration project each time. Show how deployment time decreases with experience."
    },
    {
      "category": "Hardware Strategy",
      "question": "What's your hardware strategy—build custom vs. integrate existing platforms?",
      "answer": "Hardware strategy significantly impacts capital intensity and time-to-market. Custom hardware provides differentiation but requires more capital and development time. Integrating existing platforms (mobile bases, arms, sensors) accelerates development but may limit capabilities. Present your approach with clear rationale. Address how strategy evolves as you scale. Show you understand the trade-offs and have made a deliberate choice."
    },
    {
      "category": "Safety Framework",
      "question": "How do you ensure safety when operating around humans?",
      "answer": "Safety is non-negotiable in robotics, especially for human-proximate operation. Present your safety framework: sensing, prediction, reactive behaviors, fail-safes. Show your safety testing methodology and results. Address relevant safety standards (ISO 10218, ISO 13849) and compliance status. Include any safety certifications or third-party validation. Safety failures can end a robotics company—show you take it seriously."
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer ROI",
      "question": "What's the customer ROI and how long until payback?",
      "answer": "Robots must deliver clear economic value. Present customer ROI analysis: labor costs replaced or augmented, productivity improvements, quality gains. Show payback period on robot investment—ideally under 18-24 months. Include total cost of ownership: robot cost, deployment, maintenance, support. Reference customer validation of ROI claims. Economic value must be compelling enough to overcome adoption friction."
    },
    {
      "category": "Technical Moat",
      "question": "What's technically differentiated about your approach?",
      "answer": "Robotics technical differentiation can come from many sources: perception algorithms, motion planning, manipulation skills, learning systems, domain-specific optimization. Explain your technical advantage specifically—not generic AI claims. Show why this advantage is durable. Address whether your approach scales with data (learning effects) or requires manual engineering for each environment. Investors want to understand your technical wedge."
    },
    {
      "category": "Market Focus",
      "question": "Why did you choose this market and application?",
      "answer": "Robotics companies succeed by deeply solving specific problems before generalizing. Explain your market choice: why this application is good for robotics, why it's good for your team, why timing is right. Show deep understanding of customer workflows and pain points. Address market size realistically—robotics markets are often smaller than software. Demonstrate you're building a wedge that can expand."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team Experience",
      "question": "What robotics deployment experience does your team have?",
      "answer": "Robotics requires unique skills: mechanical engineering, controls, perception, integration, and field deployment experience. Highlight team backgrounds in robotics specifically—this is different from general software engineering. Show prior robotics products shipped or deployed. Address gaps with hiring plan or advisors. Investors value teams who've seen robots fail in the field and learned from it."

    {
      "objection": "Your demos look impressive, but how do we know this works in the real world?",
      "response": "Acknowledge demo skepticism directly—it's valid in robotics. Present data from real customer deployments: runtime hours, task success rates, intervention frequency. Show the range of conditions you've operated in. Include customer testimonials on real-world performance. If limited deployment, be honest about it and present your validation plan with specific milestones. The goal is demonstrating you understand the demo-to-deployment gap."

Present your scalability plan: deployment team structure, remote monitoring capabilities, customer success approach. Reference metrics that indicate scalability: declining deployment time, improving support efficiency. Show you're building a business, not a series of custom integrations."

      "response": "Present detailed customer economics: robot cost, deployment, ongoing support and maintenance. Show ROI analysis based on labor savings or productivity gains. Include payback period and compare to customer investment criteria. Address hardware cost trajectory with volume. If offering RaaS (Robot-as-a-Service), show the unit economics of that model. Customer economics must be compelling."

      "objection": "What happens when your robot fails or causes damage in production?",
      "response": "Address safety and liability directly. Present your safety framework and testing results. Show your incident response process for failures. Discuss insurance approach and any safety certifications. Reference your track record—incidents avoided, minor issues handled well. Demonstrate you've thought through failure modes and have appropriate risk management."
