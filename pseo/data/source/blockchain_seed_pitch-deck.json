  "title": "Pitch deck outline for Blockchain Seed startups",
  "summary": "Blockchain seed pitch decks must overcome significant investor skepticism post-crypto winter. Lead with real utility and sustainable economics, not token price potential. Show you understand why most crypto projects failed and why yours is different. Credibility comes from substance, not hype. Pitchchat turns your deck into an interactive pitch room for investors.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Problem & Opportunity",
      "goal": "Frame a real problem that blockchain uniquely solves",
      "guidance": "Identify a specific problem where blockchain properties (trustlessness, permissionlessness, programmable ownership) provide genuine advantages. Show why centralized solutions are inadequate. Avoid generic 'disintermediation' claims—be specific about the value blockchain creates. Size the opportunity realistically."
    },
    {
      "title": "Solution & Why Blockchain",
      "goal": "Demonstrate blockchain necessity and your specific approach",
      "guidance": "Present your solution with clear explanation of why it requires blockchain. Show the specific properties you leverage: censorship resistance, composability, trustless coordination. Demonstrate your technical approach and architecture decisions. This is the most important slide—weak blockchain justification kills deals."
    },
    {
      "title": "Product & Traction",
      "goal": "Show real usage and product-market fit signals",
      "guidance": "Present your product with user metrics. Show active wallets, transaction volume, and retention without artificial incentives if possible. Include user testimonials and use cases. Demonstrate organic demand beyond speculation. For pre-launch, show waitlist and community engagement quality."
    },
    {
      "title": "Token Model (if applicable)",
      "goal": "Explain tokenomics clearly and justify token necessity",
      "guidance": "If you have a token, present its utility and necessity for the system. Show tokenomics: supply, distribution, emission schedule, value accrual. Address sustainability without continuous new capital. Show regulatory positioning. If no token yet, explain if/when you might add one and why."
    },
    {
      "title": "Business Model & Revenue",
      "goal": "Show sustainable economics beyond token appreciation",
      "guidance": "Present actual revenue model: protocol fees, enterprise services, SaaS components. Show revenue generated or clear path to revenue. Address how revenue relates to token value if applicable. Demonstrate you're building a business, not just a token."
    },
    {
      "title": "Security & Compliance",
      "goal": "Address the two existential risks directly",
      "guidance": "Present security approach: audits completed, ongoing processes, bug bounties. Show regulatory strategy: legal positioning, compliance infrastructure, jurisdictional approach. These are existential risks—dedicate a slide to addressing them directly. Reference legal counsel and security partners."
    },
    {
      "title": "Competitive Landscape",
      "goal": "Position against existing protocols and alternatives",
      "guidance": "Map the competitive landscape: other protocols, centralized alternatives, potential new entrants. Show your differentiation and why users choose you. Address network effects and moats. Include win/loss data if available. Demonstrate deep understanding of the space."
    },
    {
      "title": "Team & Advisors",
      "goal": "Show crypto-native expertise and relevant experience",
      "guidance": "Highlight team crypto experience: prior protocols, DeFi background, security expertise. Include relevant advisors and their involvement. Show community building capability. Address any gaps in the team. Crypto expertise is essential—demonstrate yours clearly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roadmap & Milestones",
      "goal": "Present clear development and growth path",
      "guidance": "Show development roadmap: technical milestones, product launches, ecosystem expansion. Include go-to-market milestones: user growth, partnership targets, revenue goals. Present decentralization roadmap if relevant. Be realistic about crypto development timelines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Funding & Use of Funds",
      "goal": "Present capital needs and allocation",
      "guidance": "Show raise amount and detailed use of funds: development, security, growth, operations. Present runway and path to next milestones.
