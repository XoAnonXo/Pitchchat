  "title": "Investor questions for SaaS Seed startups",
  "summary": "Seed-stage SaaS startups face intense scrutiny on product-market fit signals, unit economics trajectory, and path to scalable growth. Investors evaluate whether your subscription model can achieve the metrics needed for venture-scale returns. The bar has risen significantly—investors now expect early evidence of retention and willingness to pay, not just user acquisition. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics",
      "question": "What's your current CAC:LTV ratio and path to 3:1?",
      "answer": "At seed stage, investors expect you to understand your unit economics even if they're not yet optimized. Break down your Customer Acquisition Cost by channel (paid, organic, sales-led) and explain your assumptions for Lifetime Value based on current churn rates and expansion revenue. Most seed SaaS companies show CAC:LTV between 1:1 and 2:1, with a clear plan to reach 3:1+ through improved retention, pricing optimization, or channel efficiency. Show your cohort analysis if available—even 3-6 months of data demonstrates analytical rigor and gives investors confidence in your trajectory."
    },
    {
      "category": "Retention",
      "question": "What does your retention look like and what's driving churn?",
      "answer": "Logo retention and net revenue retention are the most important SaaS metrics. Present your monthly or weekly retention curves by cohort. If retention is below benchmarks (85%+ monthly for SMB, 95%+ for enterprise), explain what you've learned about why customers leave and your specific initiatives to improve. Show you understand the difference between product issues, fit issues, and support issues. The best answers demonstrate deep customer understanding: 'Our churn is primarily in month 2-3 among companies under 20 employees who don't integrate with their CRM. We're addressing this with improved onboarding and a Salesforce integration shipping next month.'"
    },
    {
      "category": "Go-to-Market",
      "question": "What's your primary acquisition channel and is it scalable?",
      "answer": "Present your customer acquisition strategy with channel-by-channel breakdown. Whether you're sales-led, product-led, or marketing-led, show early evidence that your primary channel works. Address CAC by channel and efficiency trends. For product-led growth, show activation and conversion metrics. For sales-led, show pipeline and conversion rates. Investors want to see a repeatable motion emerging—even if it's early—and evidence you can scale it with capital. Be honest about what's working and what's experimental."
    },
    {
      "category": "Product-Market Fit",
      "question": "How do you know you have product-market fit?",
      "answer": "Product-market fit is hard to measure precisely, but strong signals include: organic growth and word-of-mouth referrals, customers who use the product repeatedly without prompting, low churn in your target segment, customers who expand their usage over time, and qualitative feedback indicating the product is essential. Present your evidence across multiple dimensions. The 'Sean Ellis test' (would customers be disappointed if the product went away?) is useful but not sufficient alone. Show patterns in customer behavior that indicate genuine pull."
    },
    {
      "category": "Pricing",
      "question": "How did you arrive at your pricing and is there room to grow ARPU?",
      "answer": "Walk through your pricing methodology: did you test different price points, analyze willingness to pay, benchmark competitors? Show your current ARPU and explain expansion revenue potential. Most seed SaaS companies are underpriced—explain if you believe that's true for you and how you might address it. Present your pricing structure (per seat, usage-based, tiered) and why it aligns with customer value. Address any pricing friction you've observed in sales conversations."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competition",
      "question": "How do you compete against established players and well-funded startups?",
      "answer": "SaaS markets are usually competitive. Present your competitive positioning honestly: where you win, where you lose, and why. Avoid the trap of claiming you have no competitors or that you're better in every dimension. Show your specific differentiation: is it product capabilities, market focus, pricing, or distribution? Reference actual competitive situations—wins and losses—and what you learned. Investors value founders who understand their competitive landscape deeply and have made deliberate positioning choices."
    },
    {
      "category": "Technical Moat",
      "question": "What's defensible about your product beyond execution speed?",
      "answer": "Speed to market is valuable but not a moat. Explain what becomes harder to replicate over time: proprietary data that improves with usage, network effects, deep integrations with customer systems, workflow embedding that increases switching costs, or specialized domain expertise encoded in the product. The best SaaS companies build compounding advantages—show how your product becomes more valuable and more defensible as you grow. Be specific about what a well-funded competitor couldn't replicate in 18 months."
    },
    {
      "category": "Market Size",
      "question": "How big is your market and how do you size it?",
      "answer": "Present bottom-up market sizing that investors can validate. Start with your target customer profile: how many exist, what they pay for adjacent solutions, what your solution is worth to them. Calculate your serviceable addressable market before jumping to TAM. Explain your expansion path from initial wedge to broader market. Reference comparable SaaS companies' market sizes where relevant. Top-down TAM numbers get discounted heavily—show you understand your specific entry point and expansion trajectory."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team",
      "question": "Why is this team positioned to win in this market?",
      "answer": "Explain your team's relevant advantages: domain expertise, technical capabilities, prior startup experience, or unique insights into the customer problem. Be honest about gaps and how you plan to fill them. For SaaS, investors often look for commercial DNA (sales/marketing leadership) alongside technical founders—address whether you have this or plan to add it. Show evidence of ability to recruit: early hires, advisors, or committed candidates. Team is often the primary bet at seed stage."
    },
    {
      "category": "Milestones",
      "question": "What milestones will this round achieve and what does Series A look like?",
      "answer": "Present 3-5 concrete milestones this capital achieves: typically a mix of product (feature launches, platform capabilities), commercial (ARR targets, customer logos, NRR benchmarks), and team (key hires) goals. Show you understand what Series A investors in your space typically require—usually $1-3M ARR, strong retention, and a repeatable go-to-market motion. Explain the logical sequence of milestones and how they de-risk the business. Be realistic about timeline—most seed companies take 18-24 months to Series A."

      "response": "Acknowledge churn concerns directly with data: 'Our monthly churn is currently 6%, which is above the 4% benchmark for seed-stage SMB SaaS. Here's our analysis of why customers leave and our three-part retention strategy: 1) Onboarding improvements that increased 30-day activation from 40% to 65% in our last cohort, 2) Feature additions addressing the top churn driver (lack of integrations), shipping in Q2, 3) Customer success outreach for accounts showing declining usage patterns. We expect these to reduce churn to 4% within two quarters based on early cohort data.'"
    },
    {
      "objection": "This looks like a feature, not a company.",
      "response": "Address the platform vs. feature concern directly. Show your expansion roadmap: adjacent problems you can solve, additional modules in development, and customer feedback indicating willingness to consolidate more spend with you. Reference comparable companies that started narrow and expanded into platforms. Demonstrate network effects or data advantages that compound over time. Show evidence customers want you to do more, not just do one thing better."

    {
      "objection": "Customer acquisition costs are too high to scale profitably.",
      "response": "Present your CAC trajectory and improvement levers. Show CAC by channel with plans to shift toward more efficient channels. Demonstrate organic growth and referral mechanisms that improve blended CAC over time. If relying on sales, show how automation and process improvements reduce CAC at scale. Reference LTV expansion that justifies higher CAC. Be realistic about the path while showing specific initiatives that improve efficiency."

      "objection": "The market is too competitive with established players and funded startups.",
      "response": "Competition validates the market. Present your differentiated positioning: specific customer segment, use case, or approach where you win. Show win rates against named competitors and why. Reference early traction as evidence of competitive viability. Address barriers to entry in your specific niche. Acknowledge competition honestly while demonstrating you've found a defensible position with evidence."
