  "title": "Investor questions for Finance Seed startups",
  "summary": "Seed-stage fintech startups face intense scrutiny around regulatory pathways, unit economics, and the challenge of building trust in financial services. Investors evaluate your compliance infrastructure, banking relationships, and path to sustainable customer economics. The fintech playbook of 'grow now, profit later' has been discredited—seed stage investors now want to see efficient customer acquisition and clear paths to profitability. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Regulatory Strategy",
      "question": "What licenses do you need and what's your regulatory strategy?",
      "answer": "Fintech regulatory requirements vary dramatically by product type and geography. Present your regulatory map: which licenses you need (money transmitter, lending, banking charter, broker-dealer), current status, and timeline. Show your compliance approach: in-house expertise, regulatory counsel, compliance technology. Address your path to operating legally—investors have seen too many fintechs delayed or shut down by regulatory issues. Be specific about what you can and cannot do today."
    },
    {
      "category": "Banking Partnership",
      "question": "Who are your banking partners and how stable are those relationships?",
      "answer": "Most fintechs operate through banking partnerships (BaaS providers, sponsor banks). Present your partnership structure: who you're working with, contract terms, dependency risks. Address the recent banking partner challenges in fintech—show why your relationships are stable. If pursuing your own charter, explain the timeline and interim strategy. Investors want to understand your infrastructure dependencies and risks."
    },
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics",
      "question": "What are your unit economics and customer acquisition costs?",
      "answer": "Post-fintech bubble, unit economics scrutiny is intense. Present your customer acquisition cost with channel breakdown. Show customer lifetime value based on actual behavior, not projections. Calculate LTV:CAC ratio and payback period. Address cohort economics—do early customers behave differently than recent ones? Show path to improving economics at scale. Investors need confidence your growth is profitable, not just fast."
    },
    {
      "category": "Fraud & Risk",
      "question": "How do you manage fraud and credit risk?",
      "answer": "Financial services carry inherent fraud and credit risk. Present your risk framework: identity verification, fraud detection, credit underwriting (if applicable). Show your loss rates and how they compare to industry benchmarks. Address your risk infrastructure: vendor stack, proprietary models, human review. Include any early warning indicators you track. Risk management capability is essential for fintech credibility."
    },
    {
      "category": "Market Focus",
      "question": "Why this market segment and what's your right to win?",
      "answer": "Fintech is crowded—justify your market choice. Explain your target segment: who they are, why they're underserved, why existing solutions fail them. Show your unique advantages: distribution, product differentiation, cost structure, or trust. Present evidence of segment fit: early traction, customer feedback, segment-specific metrics. Your right to win should be specific and defensible."
    },
    {
      "category": "Revenue Model",
      "question": "How do you make money and what's the revenue trajectory?",
      "answer": "Fintech revenue models vary: interchange, interest margin, subscriptions, transaction fees, or premium features. Present your revenue model clearly: primary sources, margin structure, and trajectory. Show revenue you've generated or clear evidence of willingness to pay. Address how revenue model scales with customer base. Investors want to understand the economics engine, not just customer growth."
    },
    {
      "category": "Trust & Brand",
      "question": "How do you build trust with customers for their financial services?",
      "answer": "Financial services require deep customer trust. Present your trust-building approach: brand positioning, security communication, customer support quality. Show evidence of trust: NPS scores, customer testimonials, retention rates. Address any trust challenges your segment faces. Include security posture and how you communicate it. Trust is harder to build in finance—show you understand this."
    },
    {
      "category": "Technology Stack",
      "question": "What's your technology architecture and what do you build vs. buy?",
      "answer": "Fintech requires sophisticated technology across payments, compliance, and security. Present your architecture: core systems, vendor dependencies, proprietary components. Explain build vs. buy decisions with rationale. Address technology scalability and reliability requirements. Show security architecture given financial data sensitivity. Investors evaluate whether your tech foundation supports scale."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Differentiation",
      "question": "How do you compete against established banks and other fintechs?",
      "answer": "Fintech faces competition from incumbents and well-funded startups. Present your competitive positioning: how you win against banks (experience, cost, access) and other fintechs (differentiation, segment focus). Show customer acquisition in competitive context. Address barriers to entry in your segment. Demonstrate sustainable differentiation, not just feature parity."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team Experience",
      "question": "What financial services experience does your team have?",
      "answer": "Fintech requires domain expertise in regulation, risk, and operations. Highlight team backgrounds: prior fintech or banking experience, compliance expertise, relevant domain knowledge. Be honest about gaps and plans to fill them. Show advisors who add credibility. Investors value teams who understand financial services complexity—it's different from general tech."

    {
      "objection": "The big banks are investing heavily in digital—how do you compete?",

Present your advantages: speed, focus, modern infrastructure, customer experience. Reference areas where fintechs have won despite bank investment. Demonstrate you're building in segments where banks are disadvantaged, not just competing on features."

    {
      "objection": "Regulatory changes could shut down your business model.",
