  "title": "Investor questions for Hardware Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A hardware companies must demonstrate they've solved the prototype-to-production challenge. Investors evaluate manufacturing scalability, proven unit economics, and meaningful customer traction. The bar has risen—investors now require evidence of production capability and positive gross margins before Series A investment. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Production Readiness",
      "question": "What's your current production capability and how does it scale?",
      "answer": "Series A hardware companies should have production proven at low rate. Present your current production capacity, yield rates, and cycle time. Show your scaling roadmap: equipment investments, staffing, facility expansion. For CM partnerships, show the relationship maturity and capacity commitments. Demonstrate you've solved manufacturing—not just designed a product. Include production quality metrics and improvement trajectory."
    },
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics",
      "question": "What are your current unit economics and how do they improve with scale?",
      "answer": "Production unit economics should be proven, not assumed. Present current BOM, manufacturing overhead, and gross margin. Show the path to target margins at scale: volume pricing commitments, manufacturing efficiency improvements, design optimizations. Include fully-loaded product cost including warranty, support, and logistics. Investors need confidence that selling more products improves the business."
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Traction",

Include repeat purchase rate if applicable. For B2B, show contract value and expansion within accounts. Demonstrate that customers derive real value—net promoter scores, testimonials, reorder rates. Quality of traction matters as much as quantity."
    },
    {
      "category": "Supply Chain Maturity",
      "question": "How mature is your supply chain and what are the remaining risks?",
      "answer": "Series A supply chains should be production-qualified. Show your supplier portfolio: number of suppliers, qualification status, relationship depth. Present inventory management approach: safety stock strategy, lead time management, demand forecasting. Address remaining risks: single-source components, long lead items, price volatility. Demonstrate you've built supply chain resilience—not just assembled a BOM."
    },
    {
      "category": "Quality Systems",
      "question": "What's your quality system and how do you ensure production consistency?",
      "answer": "Scaling production requires robust quality systems. Present your quality approach: inspection points, testing coverage, SPC implementation. Show quality metrics: FPY at scale, defect rates, customer return rates. For regulated products, show compliance status. Include warranty cost trends and root cause analysis process. Demonstrate that quality is systematic, not hero-dependent."
    },
    {
      "category": "Go-to-Market Execution",
      "question": "How are you reaching customers and what's the sales efficiency?",
      "answer": "Hardware GTM has unique challenges: distribution complexity, inventory management, channel margins. Present your sales strategy: direct vs. channel mix, geographic priorities, partnership approach. Show customer acquisition cost and payback period. For channel sales, show partner productivity. Demonstrate you've cracked distribution—not just built a product people want."
    },
    {
      "category": "Working Capital",
      "question": "What are your working capital requirements and how do you manage cash conversion?",
      "answer": "Hardware businesses tie up cash in inventory and receivables. Present your cash conversion cycle: inventory turns, DSO, DPO. Show working capital requirements at current scale and how they change with growth. Include inventory management strategy and any supply chain financing. Investors need to understand the capital efficiency of scaling hardware."
    },
    {
      "category": "Product Roadmap",
      "question": "What's your product roadmap and how does it leverage your platform?",
      "answer": "Single-product hardware companies face commodity risk. Present your product roadmap: variants, generations, adjacencies. Show how you leverage existing technology, manufacturing capability, and customer relationships. Include margin improvement on next-generation products. Demonstrate you're building a platform, not just a product. Address feature prioritization based on customer feedback."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Moat",
      "question": "How defensible is your position as you scale?",
      "answer": "Hardware moats include: manufacturing expertise, supply chain relationships, IP, brand, and ecosystem. Present your competitive advantages and how they strengthen with scale. Show why competitors can't easily replicate your position. Address incumbent response and new entrant risk. Include any network effects or ecosystem lock-in. Demonstrate increasing returns to scale."
    },
    {
      "category": "Capital Path",
      "question": "What's the capital required to reach profitability?",
      "answer": "Hardware profitability requires scale. Present your path to break-even: revenue required, margin improvement, operating leverage. Show total capital needed to reach profitability. Include scenario analysis for faster or slower growth. Address working capital requirements at scale. Demonstrate you understand the capital journey and have a realistic plan."
