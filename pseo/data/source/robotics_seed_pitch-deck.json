  "title": "Pitch deck outline for Robotics Seed startups",
  "summary": "Robotics seed pitch decks must bridge the gap between impressive technology and real-world viability. Investors are skeptical of demos—show production reality. Lead with customer deployment evidence, not lab capabilities. Demonstrate you understand the challenges of deploying robots at scale. Pitchchat turns your deck into an interactive pitch room for investors.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Robot in Action",
      "goal": "Show the robot doing real work, not demo tasks",
      "guidance": "Open with video or images of the robot in actual customer environments—not a lab demo. Show the real task being performed. Include customer context: what environment, what problem. Make it tangible and credible. Avoid over-edited demo videos that hide failures."
    },
    {
      "title": "Problem & Market",
      "goal": "Frame the problem and why robotics is the right solution",
      "guidance": "Identify specific workflows where robotics creates clear value. Show the pain point: labor shortages, dangerous tasks, productivity constraints. Size the market based on specific customer segments. Explain why robotics is newly viable for this application—technology enablers, cost trajectory, or workflow changes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Solution & Capabilities",
      "goal": "Demonstrate technical capabilities with production evidence",
      "guidance": "Present robot capabilities with specificity: task types, success rates, operational conditions. Show technical differentiation from other approaches. Include metrics from real deployments, not lab benchmarks. Address the gap between current capabilities and production requirements with clear development path."
    },
    {
      "title": "Deployment Reality",
      "goal": "Show you understand the deployment challenge",
      "guidance": "Present your deployment process: timeline, customer requirements, training needs. Show deployment learnings and process improvements. Address scaling challenges and how you'll address them. This slide separates real robotics companies from research projects."
    },
    {
      "title": "Customer Evidence",
      "goal": "Let pilot customers validate your robot",
      "guidance": "Present pilot deployment results: runtime, success rates, customer feedback. Include testimonials from customers who've deployed your robot. Show diversity of pilots if applicable. Address any pilot failures and learnings. Customer evidence is the most credible proof in robotics."
    },
    {
      "title": "Customer Economics",
      "goal": "Demonstrate clear customer ROI",
      "guidance": "Present customer economic analysis: labor costs, productivity gains, total ROI. Show payback period on robot investment. Include total cost of ownership: purchase, deployment, support. Reference customer validation of ROI. Economics must be compelling to overcome adoption friction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Business Model",
      "goal": "Show how you'll make money",
      "guidance": "Present pricing model: hardware sale, RaaS, hybrid approach. Show unit economics at scale. Include service revenue streams: deployment, support, upgrades. Address working capital implications of hardware business. Demonstrate you've thought through the business model challenges."
    },
    {
      "title": "Competitive Landscape",
      "goal": "Position against other approaches",
      "guidance": "Map competitive landscape: other robotics companies, automation alternatives, status quo. Show differentiation on dimensions that matter to customers. Address large companies (Amazon, Google) potentially entering your space. Include technical comparisons where you have advantages."
    },
    {
      "title": "Team",
      "goal": "Demonstrate robotics expertise and deployment experience",
      "guidance": "Highlight robotics-specific experience: prior robots deployed, technical depth, field experience. Address key capabilities: mechanical, perception, controls, deployment. Show advisors who fill gaps. Robotics investors value teams who've seen robots fail in the field."
    },
    {
      "title": "Funding & Milestones",
      "goal": "Present capital needs and path to production scale",
      "guidance": "Show raise amount and use of funds: development, pilots, hardware. Present milestones this capital achieves: success rate targets, deployment count, revenue. Include total capital path to production scale. Be realistic about robotics capital intensity and timeline."
