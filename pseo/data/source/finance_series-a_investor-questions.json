  "title": "Investor questions for Finance Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A fintech companies must demonstrate proven unit economics, regulatory stability, and scalable operations. Investors evaluate your path to profitability, compliance infrastructure maturity, and ability to scale customer acquisition efficiently. The era of growth-at-all-costs fintech is over—Series A now requires evidence of sustainable business fundamentals. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics at Scale",
      "question": "What are your unit economics and how do they improve with scale?",
      "answer": "Series A fintech requires proven, improving unit economics. Present your current metrics: CAC by channel, LTV based on mature cohorts, payback period, gross margin. Show how economics have improved from seed stage. Present scale economics: how CAC decreases with brand awareness, how LTV increases with product expansion. Demonstrate a path to 4:1+ LTV:CAC and sub-12-month payback. Investors need confidence that growth is profitable."
    },
    {
      "category": "Regulatory Maturity",
      "question": "What's your regulatory status and how have you de-risked compliance?",
      "answer": "Series A fintechs should have significant regulatory progress. Show licenses obtained and applications in final stages. Present compliance infrastructure: team size, technology stack, audit history. Address any regulatory examinations or feedback received. For banking partnerships, show relationship stability and depth. Demonstrate compliance is a competitive advantage, not just a cost center. Regulatory maturity reduces risk for Series A investors."
    },
    {
      "category": "Customer Acquisition Scalability",
      "question": "How does customer acquisition scale and what's your channel strategy?",
      "answer": "Fintech CAC often increases with scale as easy channels saturate. Present your channel portfolio and performance by channel. Show how you're diversifying acquisition: new channels, partnerships, brand marketing. Address CAC trajectory projections and assumptions. Include any viral or organic growth contribution. Demonstrate a scalable acquisition model, not just current efficiency."
    },
    {
      "category": "Revenue Growth & Diversification",
      "question": "What's your revenue growth rate and how are you diversifying revenue?",
      "answer": "Series A fintechs should show strong revenue growth with emerging diversification. Present revenue growth trajectory and drivers. Show revenue mix: primary product, adjacent products, cross-sell success. Address revenue per customer trends and expansion within accounts. Include net revenue retention showing customers increasing value. Demonstrate you're building a platform, not a single product."
    },
    {
      "category": "Risk Management Maturity",
      "question": "How has your risk management matured and what are your loss rates?",
      "answer": "Scaled fintech requires sophisticated risk management. Present your risk metrics: fraud rates, credit losses (if applicable), operational losses. Show trajectory and comparison to industry benchmarks. Demonstrate risk infrastructure evolution: technology, team, processes. Address how risk management scales with volume. Include any stress testing or scenario analysis. Risk management maturity is essential for Series A fintech credibility."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Position",
      "question": "How has your competitive position strengthened and what's your moat?",
      "answer": "At Series A, competitive position should be clearly differentiated. Present your moat components: customer relationships, data advantages, network effects, brand, regulatory position, or cost structure. Show evidence of moat: retention vs. competitors, pricing power, customer feedback. Address competitive threats and your response. Demonstrate increasing returns to scale that protect your position."
    },
    {
      "category": "Operational Scalability",
      "question": "How do your operations scale with customer growth?",
      "answer": "Fintech operations can become bottlenecks at scale. Present operational metrics: support efficiency, onboarding time, manual process rates. Show automation progress and remaining manual dependencies. Address compliance operations scalability. Include operational infrastructure investments made. Demonstrate you can serve 10x customers without proportional cost increase."
    },
    {
      "category": "Banking & Infrastructure",
      "question": "How stable is your banking infrastructure and what's the path to greater independence?",
      "answer": "Banking infrastructure is critical for fintech scale. Present banking partner relationships: stability indicators, capacity for scale, contractual position. Address any infrastructure diversification or redundancy. If pursuing own charter or licenses, show timeline and interim strategy. Demonstrate you've built infrastructure resilience appropriate for scale."
    },
    {
      "category": "Product Expansion",
      "question": "What's your product roadmap and expansion strategy?",

Show customer demand evidence for expansion areas. Address cross-sell success to date. Include regulatory requirements for new products. Demonstrate you're building a platform with natural expansion paths, not a feature that will be commoditized."
    },
    {
      "category": "Path to Profitability",
      "question": "What's your path to profitability and how much capital is required?",
      "answer": "Fintech investors now require clear profitability paths. Present your model: revenue growth required, margin improvement trajectory, operating leverage.
