  "title": "Aerospace Seed fundraising metrics benchmarks",
  "summary": "Seed-stage aerospace metrics focus on technical progress, team strength, and early commercial validation. Unlike software startups, aerospace companies are measured on development milestones and risk reduction rather than revenue growth. These benchmarks help investors assess your technical and commercial maturity. Pitchchat keeps fundraising metrics investor-ready in one room.",
