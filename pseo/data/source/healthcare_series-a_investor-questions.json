  "title": "Investor questions for Healthcare Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A healthcare companies must demonstrate regulatory progress (typically cleared or submitted), clinical validation, and early commercial traction. Investors evaluate your ability to scale in a complex market—reimbursement, health system adoption, and operational readiness become central. The bar has risen: investors expect proof of product-market fit through paying customers or contracted pilots, not just clinical enthusiasm. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Regulatory",
      "question": "What's your regulatory status and post-market strategy?",
      "answer": "Present your regulatory achievements and remaining work. For cleared products, explain any labeling limitations and expansion plans (additional indications, international clearances). For products in review, provide timeline and contingency plans. Address post-market requirements: surveillance, adverse event reporting, quality systems maintenance. Show you've built regulatory operations to scale, not just achieve initial clearance. Reference any FDA feedback that supports your path."
    },
    {
      "category": "Clinical Evidence",
      "question": "What clinical evidence supports your efficacy claims and what's the publication strategy?",
      "answer": "Series A requires robust clinical evidence. Present your evidence portfolio: pivotal data, real-world evidence, outcomes studies. Explain how evidence supports regulatory claims, reimbursement, and sales. Show your publication strategy—peer-reviewed papers build credibility with clinical buyers. Address evidence gaps and plans to fill them. Reference KOL relationships and their role in evidence generation and dissemination."
    },
    {
      "category": "Reimbursement",
      "question": "What's your reimbursement status and payer strategy?",
      "answer": "Reimbursement determines commercial viability. Present your current coverage: which payers, what codes, what rates. Explain your payer engagement strategy and any coverage wins. Address the Medicare vs. commercial payer dynamic in your category. Show health economics data supporting reimbursement. For new technology categories, explain the NTAP, coverage with evidence development, or alternative pathways you're pursuing. Reference any medical policy decisions or coverage momentum."
    },
    {
      "category": "Commercial Traction",
      "question": "What's your commercial traction and sales efficiency?",
      "answer": "Series A expects commercial proof points. Present revenue, contracted customers, and pipeline. Show sales metrics: cycle length, win rate, deal size. Explain your sales motion: who sells, to whom, how. Address health system procurement complexity and how you navigate it. Show unit economics on customer acquisition. Reference lighthouse customers and their expansion potential. Demonstrate you've found a repeatable commercial motion."
    },
    {
      "category": "Health System Strategy",
      "question": "How do you land and expand within health systems?",
      "answer": "Health systems buy slowly but expand if products deliver value. Explain your land strategy: initial entry point, champion development, pilot-to-purchase conversion. Show expansion playbook: additional units, use cases, or products within accounts. Present evidence from existing customers: utilization growth, departmental expansion, contract renewals. Address account management approach and success metrics. Reference specific expansion examples."
    },
    {
      "category": "Clinical Workflow",
      "question": "How deeply integrated is your product in clinical workflows?",
      "answer": "Workflow integration creates stickiness and switching costs. Present your integration approach: EHR integration status, clinical workflow embedding, training requirements. Show adoption metrics within accounts: daily active users, utilization rates, workflow penetration. Address barriers to adoption you've encountered and how you've solved them. Reference clinical user feedback on workflow fit. Show you understand the change management required for clinical adoption."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Position",
      "question": "How has your competitive position evolved and what's defensible?",
      "answer": "Series A investors assess long-term defensibility. Present your competitive landscape with honest positioning. Show evidence of differentiation: clinical outcomes, workflow advantages, customer preference data. Address how you win against specific competitors—reference actual deals. Explain what's defensible: clinical evidence moat, integration depth, network effects, regulatory barriers. Address emerging competitors and your response strategy."
    },
    {
      "category": "Operations Scale",
      "question": "What operational capabilities have you built to scale?",
      "answer": "Scaling healthcare requires operational maturity. Present your quality management system and regulatory operations. Address manufacturing or service delivery capacity. Show customer success and implementation capabilities. Explain your technology infrastructure for scaling. Reference any operational challenges you've faced and how you've resolved them. Healthcare investors know operations are hard—show you've built foundations."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team",
      "question": "How has your team evolved for Series A scale?",

    },
    {
      "category": "Milestones",
      "question": "What does this round achieve and what triggers Series B?",
      "answer": "Present concrete milestones: revenue targets ($3-10M ARR typical for healthcare Series A→B), market penetration goals, product expansion, team growth. Show you understand Series B requirements in healthcare: typically $10M+ ARR, strong unit economics, and a clear path to profitability or category leadership. Explain the 18-24 month plan and key de-risking events. Be realistic about healthcare's longer timelines and what this capital achieves."

  "objections": [
    {
      "objection": "Your sales cycles are too long to build a venture-scale business.",
      "response": "Address with evidence and strategy: 'Our initial sales cycles were 15 months. Through our refined approach, we've reduced to 8 months for new accounts. Key changes: earlier economic buyer engagement, standardized ROI analysis, and pilot-to-purchase conversion playbook. More importantly, our expansion within accounts averages 3 months with 140% NRR. Our model is land efficiently, then expand significantly. We're now seeing inbound from health system networks that accelerate the process further.'"
    },
    {
      "objection": "Reimbursement coverage is too limited to scale.",
      "response": "Present your reimbursement progress: 'We've achieved coverage with 4 major commercial payers representing 40% of covered lives in our initial markets. Our health economics data shows $X savings per patient, which supports our coverage expansion. We have active coverage reviews with 3 additional payers and expect decisions in the next 6 months. Our pricing strategy works across reimbursed and cash-pay channels, providing multiple paths to revenue while coverage expands.'"
    },
    {
      "objection": "The market is being consolidated by larger players.",
      "response": "Address market dynamics directly: 'Consolidation actually benefits us. Large players acquire capabilities rather than build—we're a logical acquisition target. In the meantime, we win because we're focused: our clinical outcomes and workflow integration exceed what consolidated players offer. Our recent competitive wins against a top-3 incumbent demonstrate this. We're building a company that's valuable standalone but also strategically positioned for consolidation scenarios.'"
    },
    {
      "objection": "Your unit economics don't support the sales and implementation costs.",
      "response": "Present the economics trajectory: 'Our current CAC payback is 24 months, which is typical for enterprise healthcare at our stage. Here's our path to 18 months: implementation automation reducing costs 30%, inside sales for smaller accounts, and customer success efficiency improvements. Our LTV is strong—90%+ retention with 140% NRR gives us 5+ year customer relationships. At scale, we project CAC payback under 18 months with gross margins exceeding 75%.'"
