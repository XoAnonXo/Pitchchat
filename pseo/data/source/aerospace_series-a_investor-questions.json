  "title": "Investor questions for Aerospace Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A aerospace companies must demonstrate they've retired significant technical risk and have clear commercial traction. Investors evaluate your path from prototype to production, customer commitments, and ability to execute against major milestones. The bar has risen—Series A aerospace rounds now require meaningful technical validation and customer evidence. Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Technical Validation",
      "question": "What technical milestones have you achieved and what risks remain?",
      "answer": "Series A aerospace companies should be TRL 6-7 minimum: system prototype demonstrated in relevant environment. Present your technical accomplishments with evidence: test results, performance data, demonstration outcomes. Be transparent about remaining risks—investors respect honesty. Show your risk retirement roadmap and how this capital advances you toward production readiness (TRL 8-9)."
    },
    {
      "category": "Commercial Traction",
      "question": "What customer commitments do you have and what's the path to production contracts?",
      "answer": "Series A requires more than LOIs—investors want to see binding commitments, pilot programs, or government contracts. Present your customer pipeline: confirmed orders, paid pilots, government awards. For government-focused companies, show contract backlog and pipeline. Quantify total customer commitment value and timeline to revenue recognition. Address customer concentration if applicable."
    },
    {
      "category": "Manufacturing Scale",
      "question": "How will you scale from prototype to production manufacturing?",
      "answer": "The prototype-to-production gap kills many aerospace companies. Present your manufacturing strategy: in-house vs. contract manufacturing, facility requirements, capital equipment needs. Show your MRL progression plan and key manufacturing milestones. Reference manufacturing partnerships, supplier qualifications, and production cost targets. Demonstrate you understand the manufacturing challenges as well as the technology."
    },
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics",
      "question": "What are your unit economics at production scale and path to profitability?",
      "answer": "Aerospace unit economics differ by segment. Show your current prototype costs, target production costs at various volumes, and the path between them. Include learning curve assumptions based on industry benchmarks. Present gross margin trajectory and break-even analysis. For service models, show customer lifetime value and acquisition costs. Investors need confidence in eventual profitability."
    },
    {
      "category": "Regulatory Progress",
      "question": "What's your regulatory status and timeline to full certification?",
      "answer": "Series A aerospace companies should have significant regulatory progress: certifications in progress, launch licenses advancing, or spectrum secured. Present your regulatory timeline with milestones achieved and remaining. Show any conditional approvals or regulatory engagement that reduces uncertainty. Address regulatory risks and mitigation strategies. This is often gating to revenue—show the critical path clearly."
    },
    {
      "category": "Capital Efficiency",
      "question": "How much capital do you need to reach production and revenue, and what's the funding strategy?",
      "answer": "Aerospace Series A investors need to understand total capital requirements. Present your funding plan through production: this round's milestones, subsequent rounds, and non-dilutive sources. Show capital efficiency: cost per milestone compared to industry benchmarks. Include sensitivity analysis—what if things take longer or cost more? Demonstrate you've planned for aerospace timeline realities."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team Scaling",
      "question": "How will you scale the team for production and operations?",
      "answer": "Series A is when aerospace teams scale significantly. Present your hiring plan: key roles, timeline, compensation benchmarks. Show organizational structure evolution. Address talent competition—how do you attract engineers from primes and other startups? Include manufacturing talent strategy if building production capability. Demonstrate you've thought through the organizational challenges of scaling."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Position",
      "question": "How has your competitive position evolved and how do you maintain advantage?",
      "answer": "At Series A, you should have clearer competitive differentiation. Present win/loss data against competitors. Show technology or market advantages that have deepened. Address new entrants or incumbent moves into your space. Demonstrate customer feedback on why they chose you. Your moat should be strengthening as you progress—show evidence of this."
    },
    {
      "category": "Government vs Commercial Mix",
      "question": "What's your revenue mix strategy between government and commercial?",
      "answer": "Most aerospace companies serve both markets but with different emphasis. Present your current mix and evolution strategy. For government: contract types, margin profiles, competitive positioning for major programs. For commercial: market size, sales cycles, pricing power. Show how the mix affects your capital needs and growth trajectory. Address concentration risk in either segment."
    },
    {
      "category": "Exit Path",
      "question": "What's the realistic exit timeline and likely path for aerospace in your segment?",
      "answer": "Aerospace exits typically take longer than software. Present realistic exit scenarios: strategic acquisition by primes or tech giants, PE roll-up, or eventual IPO. Reference comparable transactions and valuation multiples. Show strategic interest you've attracted or could attract. Investors need to see liquidity path given the long journey—demonstrate you've mapped this thoughtfully."

      "objection": "Your production costs seem too optimistic given where you are in development.",
      "response": "Present your cost breakdown with evidence: current prototype costs, identified cost reduction opportunities, and industry learning curve data. Show analogous programs and their cost trajectories. Reference supplier quotes for production volumes. Be prepared to defend assumptions with specific analysis. If costs are uncertain, acknowledge it and show range scenarios with your confidence levels."
    },
    {
      "objection": "The timeline to meaningful revenue is very long—why should we invest now?",
      "response": "Aerospace investing requires long time horizons, but Series A should show accelerating progress. Present milestone-based value creation: what this capital achieves and how it changes the company's value. Show revenue ramp once production begins—aerospace companies often have steep revenue growth post-production start. Reference strategic acquisition premiums for companies at your stage. Demonstrate why this timing offers attractive entry point."
    },
    {
      "objection": "You're dependent on a few large customers—what's your concentration risk mitigation?",
      "response": "Customer concentration is common in aerospace given large contract sizes. Present your diversification strategy over time. Show contract structures that provide some protection: multi-year terms, termination provisions. Demonstrate multiple customer opportunities in pipeline. Address the strategic value of anchor customers in aerospace: validation, production learning, reference value. Show path to broader customer base."
    },
    {
      "objection": "The primes could decide to build this themselves or acquire a competitor.",
      "response": "Analyze prime contractor build-vs-buy calculus for your solution. Show why building internally is unattractive: capability gaps, timeline, opportunity cost. Reference primes' acquisition history in your space. Demonstrate relationship building with potential strategic acquirers. Show customer relationships that provide some insulation. The best answer shows you're positioned as an attractive acquisition target while building independent value."
