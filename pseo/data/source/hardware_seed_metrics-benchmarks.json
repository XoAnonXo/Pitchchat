  "title": "Hardware Seed fundraising metrics benchmarks",
  "summary": "Seed-stage hardware metrics focus on manufacturing readiness, cost trajectory, and customer validation. Unlike software, hardware companies are measured on physical product development milestones. These benchmarks help investors assess your progress toward production viability. Pitchchat keeps fundraising metrics investor-ready in one room.",
