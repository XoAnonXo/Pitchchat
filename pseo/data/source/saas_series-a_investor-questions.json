  "title": "Investor questions for SaaS Series A startups",
  "summary": "Series A SaaS investors expect proven product-market fit, repeatable go-to-market motion, and strong unit economics. The bar is high: typically $1-3M ARR, net revenue retention above 100%, and evidence that your growth engine works. Investors at this stage are betting on scalability—can you grow 3-5x with this capital while maintaining or improving efficiency? Pitchchat turns investor questions into an interactive pitch room founders can share.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "Product-Market Fit",
      "question": "What evidence proves you've achieved product-market fit?",
      "answer": "At Series A, product-market fit should be demonstrable across multiple dimensions. Present: (1) Retention data showing customers stick—monthly NRR above 100%, logo retention above 90% monthly for SMB or 97% for enterprise, (2) Growth metrics showing pull—consistent monthly growth, organic signups, referrals, (3) Customer behavior indicating dependence—high engagement, expansion over time, vocal advocacy. Include customer quotes and reference willingness. Show that PMF isn't just with early adopters but extends to your core target market. Address any segments where PMF is stronger or weaker."
    },
    {
      "category": "Unit Economics",
      "question": "Walk us through your unit economics and how they scale.",
      "answer": "Present fully-loaded CAC by channel with trend over time. Show LTV calculation based on actual customer behavior: ARPU × gross margin × (1/churn). Calculate CAC payback period and LTV:CAC ratio—Series A typically expects payback under 18 months and LTV:CAC above 3:1. Explain what improves with scale: channel efficiency, sales productivity, pricing power, reduced churn. Show cohort economics evolution. Be honest about current state while demonstrating clear trajectory. Investors will stress-test these numbers."
    },
    {
      "category": "Go-to-Market",
      "question": "Describe your go-to-market motion and evidence it's repeatable.",
      "answer": "Whether sales-led, product-led, or hybrid, show the motion works repeatedly. For sales-led: present sales productivity metrics (quota attainment, ramp time), pipeline predictability, and win rates. For product-led: show conversion funnels, activation metrics, and viral coefficients. Present customer acquisition by channel with efficiency trends. Show you've moved beyond founder-led sales to a repeatable process. Address how the motion scales with capital—can you hire salespeople who succeed? Can you spend more on marketing efficiently?"
    },
    {
      "category": "Net Revenue Retention",
      "question": "What's your NRR and what drives expansion?",
      "answer": "NRR is often the most important Series A SaaS metric. Present your NRR with methodology (monthly vs. annual calculation). Break down the components: gross retention, expansion, and contraction. Show cohort-level NRR trends. Explain expansion drivers: seat growth, upsells to higher tiers, cross-sell of new products, usage-based growth. Address any NRR headwinds and mitigation. Best-in-class Series A SaaS shows 110-130% NRR; anything below 100% requires strong explanation."
    },
    {
      "category": "Market Opportunity",
      "question": "How big is the market and what's your path to category leadership?",
      "answer": "Present market sizing that supports a venture-scale outcome. Bottom-up: your ICP count × willingness to pay. Top-down: relevant market research with your capture thesis. Show current market share and expansion path. Address the journey from initial wedge to broader platform. Series A investors need to believe this can be a $100M+ ARR company—show the path. Reference comparable companies' market positions and trajectories."
    },
    {
      "category": "Competitive Position",
      "question": "How do you win against competitors and what's your defensible moat?",
      "answer": "Present competitive positioning with evidence: win rates against specific competitors, reasons you win, reasons you lose. Show your sustainable differentiation: product capabilities, data advantages, network effects, brand, or ecosystem. Address how defensibility compounds over time. Be honest about where competitors are strong. Show you've made deliberate positioning choices rather than trying to win everywhere. Reference switching costs and customer lock-in evidence."
    },
    {
      "category": "Sales Efficiency",
      "question": "What does sales productivity look like and how does it scale?",
      "answer": "Present sales team metrics: quota attainment by rep tenure, ramp time to productivity, average deal size and sales cycle. Show sales efficiency ratio or magic number trends. Address whether you can hire salespeople who succeed at similar rates to early reps. Present your sales playbook maturity: documented process, training program, tooling. Show pipeline coverage and forecasting accuracy. Investors want confidence that capital translates to predictable revenue growth."
    },
    {
      "category": "Technology & Product",
      "question": "What's your technical architecture and product roadmap?",
      "answer": "Present technical architecture at appropriate detail: key systems, scalability approach, security posture. Address technical debt honestly and remediation plans. Show product velocity metrics and roadmap priorities. Explain build vs. buy decisions. Address platform vs. point solution trajectory. Investors want confidence your technology can support 10x scale and that product velocity continues. Include any proprietary technology or data advantages."
    },
    {
      "category": "Team & Organization",
      "question": "How will you scale the team and what key hires do you need?",
      "answer": "Present current team structure and planned evolution. Address key hires: specific roles, profiles, and timeline. Show retention metrics and culture indicators. Explain how you attract talent and your competitive positioning. For leadership gaps (often VP Sales or VP Marketing at Series A), show progress on searches or committed candidates. Demonstrate you can scale the organization, not just the product."
    },
    {
      "category": "Capital Efficiency",
      "question": "How much are you raising and what does it achieve?",
      "answer": "Present round size with specific use of funds: headcount plan, GTM investment, product development. Show 18-24 month projections with assumptions. Define milestones this capital achieves—typically 3-4x ARR growth positions you well for Series B. Present burn multiple targets (net burn / net new ARR). Show you understand capital efficiency expectations and have a plan to hit them. Address runway and path to next round."

Present specific initiatives: customer success investment, expansion pricing, cross-sell products. Set realistic improvement targets with timeline. Reference any early evidence from pilot programs. Be honest about whether this is fixable or structural."

If projecting efficiency improvement, ground it in evidence: cohort analysis of rep performance, process changes already showing results. Be realistic about timeline."

Address funding disparity by showing capital efficiency advantage. Acknowledge market reality while demonstrating viable path to leadership in your segment."
